<para>Database language: Sets the locale / language of the database contents in the system, such as the list of data elements and reports</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Sort order property: Sets the property on which the sorting of the element lists is based in the system, such as the list of data elements and indicators. Available properties are name, short name, alternative name and code. For instance, if you set the sort order property to short name, all lists will be sorted based on the short name property. You can also do manual sorting of all lists by going to the desired list and click "sort" and perform the sorting. This sorting can then be enabled by selecting custom as the sort order property.</para>

<para>Aggregation strategy: This setting defines how the system generates and provides aggregated data to the output tools. There are two options available: <emphasis role="italic">Batch</emphasis> means that all output tools like reports, charts and maps will read aggregate data from pre-built data mart tables in the database. This strategy provides the best performance and inflicts less load on the application since data retrieval only implies reading from one or a few database tables using a simple query.</para>
<para>This strategy requires that those data mart tables are populated with the relevant data before the reports are requested. This can preferably be done using nightly scheduled jobs or manually through the data mart user interface. A potential downside is that users will have to wait to the next day to view their reports after doing data entry. This approach is the recommended for large online deployments where there are medium to high user concurrency.</para>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Real-time</emphasis> means that aggregated data is generated and retrieved on-the-fly every time a report is requested. This implies that there is no delay after doing data entry before the data is accessible in reports. Performance will not scale adequately and hence this strategy is suitable for small, typically offline, deployments.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Infrastructural data elements: This setting defines a data element group where the member data elements should describe data about the infrastructure of geographic locations. Examples of such infrastructural data elements could be population, doctors, beds, internet connectivity and climate. This infrastructural data can currently be viewed in the GIS module in the station information sheet.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Infrastructural period type: Sets the frequency for which the data elements in the infrastructural data elements group are captured. This will typically be yearly. When viewing the infrastructural data you will be able to select the time period of the data source.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Feedback recipients: This setting defines a user group where the members will receive all messages being sent through the function for writing feedback in the dashboard module. This will typically be members of the super user team who are able to support and answer questions coming from end-users.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Completeness notification recipients: This setting defines a user group where the members will receive messages as notifications when a form has been marked as complete. A typical use of this is when the forms are considered to be an order of some commodity and a group of users want to be notified when such orders are placed.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Omit indicator values with zero numerator value in data mart: Defines whether aggregated indicator values with zero as the numerator value should be written to the indicator data mart table. Having such values written is required for instance when connecting Excel pivot tables to the data mart as Excel will need the numerator data to correctly aggregate up in the geographic location hierarchy. If third-party tools like Excel are not used with the application this will reduce the total number of values written to the data mart (which again will improve performance) and could safely be set to omit.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Disable data entry when data set completed: This setting defines whether the data entry forms should be disabled and prevent from further entry after they have been marked as complete.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Data analysis std dev factor: Sets the number of standard deviations for use in the outlier analysis performed on the captured data in the data entry module. The default value is 2; a high value will catch less outlier values than a low value.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Days after period end to qualify for timely data submission: Sets the number of days after the end of a period in which a data entry form must be marked as complete in order to be considered timely. This affects the &quot;reporting rate&quot; tool in the reporting module which lists forms marked as complete as well as marked as complete in time. The default value is 15.</para>

<title>Using Data Quality functionality</title>
<para>The data quality provides means to improve the accuracy and reliability of the data in the system. This can be done through validation rules and various statistical checks. All the functionality described below can be ensured that the data entered in FSNIS follows basic data quality standards.</para>
<section>
<title>Overview of data quality checks</title>
<para>Ensuring data quality is a key concern in building an effective FSNIS. Data quality has different dimensions including:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Correctness:</emphasis> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that geographic location. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Completeness:</emphasis> Data for all data elements for all geographic locations should have been submitted.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Consistency:</emphasis> Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent with other similar stations.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Timeliness:</emphasis> All data from all reporting geographic locations should be submitted at the appointed time.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section>
<title>Data quality checks</title>
<para>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element (based on all previous data registered).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Defining various validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and geographic location (s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Analysis of data sets, i.e. examining gaps in data.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Data triangulation which is comparing the same data or indicator from different sources.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</section>
<section id="validationRuleAnalysis">
<title>Running Validation Rule Analysis</title>
<para>A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met. For instance, a validation rule could assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</para>
<para>The validation rule analysis function will test validation rules against the data registered in the system. Validation violations will be reported in cases where the condition defined through the validation rule expression is not met, ie. the condition is false.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Selecting what data to validate:</emphasis> </para>
<para>First, enter a start date and an end date for which data should be included in the analysis. The date picker widget may be used to select dates. </para>
<para>Second, choose between including all validation rules or all validation rules from a single group. </para>
<para>Third, choose between including the selected geographic location only or the selected geographic location with all children in the analysis. Fourth, select the geographic location. Finally, click <emphasis role="italic">validate</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The analysis process will run for a while depending on the amount of data that is being analysed. If there were no violations of the validation rules a message saying <emphasis role="italic">validation passed successfully</emphasis> is displayed. </para>
<para>If validation violations were found, they will be presented in a list. The geographic location, period, left side description and value, operator, and right side value and description for each validation violation are displayed. </para>
<para>The show details icon can be clicked in order to get more information about a validation violation. This will open a pop up screen that provides information about the data elements included in the validation rules and their corresponding data values. This information can be used in order to fix incorrect data.</para>

<section id="stddevoutlierAnalysis">
<title>Std Dev Outlier Analysis</title>
<para>The standard deviation based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are numerically distant from the rest of the data. Outliers can occur by chance, but they often indicate a measurement error or a heavy-tailed distribution (leading to very high numbers). In the former case one wishes to discard them while in the latter case one should be cautious in using tools or interpretations that assume a normal distribution. The analysis is based on the standard normal distribution.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Select what data to analyse:</emphasis></para>
<para>First, select the from and to date for the data to include in the analysis. </para>
<para>Second, select the data set from which to pick data elements from. </para>
<para>Third, select all or some of the data elements in the data set by double-clicking or marking them and clicking the add/remove buttons. </para>
<para>Fourth, select the parent geographic location to use. All children of the geographic location will be included. </para>
<para>Fifth, select the number of standard deviations. This refers to the number of standard deviations the data is allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an outlier.</para>

<para>The potential outlier values discovered will be presented in a list after the analysis process is finished. The data element, geographic location, period, minimum value, actual value, and maximum value will be displayed for each outlier. The minimum and maximum values refer to the border values derived from the number of standard deviations selected for the analysis. </para>
<para>Each outlier value can be modified directly in the analysis result page. The value can be modified by clicking inside the corresponding field in the value column, entering a value and then navigate away from that field either by clicking tab or anywhere outside the field. The system will provide an alert if the value is still outside the defined minimum and maximum values, but the value will saved in any case. The field will have a red background color if the value is outside the range, and a green if inside. </para>
<para>Each outlier value can be marked for further follow-up by clicking the star icon.</para>
</section>
<section id="minmaxoutlierAnalysis">
<title>Min-Max Outlier Analysis</title>
<para>The min-max value based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are outside the pre-defined minimum and maximum values. Minimum and maximum values can be custom defined or automatically defined by the system in the data administration module. See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</para>
</section>
<section id="gapAnalysis">
<title>Gap Analysis</title>
<para>The gap analysis provides a mechanism for revealing gaps in the data. A gap exists for a specific data element and geographic location. A gap is a period with preceding and succeeding periods which have registered data values, but without registered data values itself. Such a gap might indicate a data capture error or omission and could be further investigated. See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</para>

<title>Datasets and data entry forms</title>
<section id="datasets">
<title>Datasets</title>
<para>All data entry in FSNIS is organised through the use of datasets. You can add and edit datasets in Maintenance-&gt;Datasets. A dataset is a collection of data elements grouped together for data collection and data export between instances of FSNIS (e.g. from a district office local installation to a national server). .</para>
<para>A dataset also has a frequency which controls the data collection frequency, which can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly. Both which data elements to include in the dataset and the frequency is set in the Add/Edit Dataset window, together with a name, short name, and code. In order to use a dataset to collect data for a specific geographic location you must assign the geographic location to the dataset and this mechanism controls which geographic locations that can use which datasets. </para>
<para>Datasets also are assigned to specific geographic location which will be allowed to enter data for all data elements in a given dataset. You can assign geographic locations to a dataset in the Dataset Management (list of available datasets are shown) by clicking on the blue folder icon, the first icon under Operations, corresponding to the dataset you would like to modify. Alternatively you can manage geographic location assignments for all datasets together in the Dataset Assignment Editor (available in the right-side menu for Datasets). </para>
<para>Your dataset will then be ready to be used in Services-&gt;Data Entry for the geographic locations that you have assigned and for periods according to your selected frequency (period type).</para>

<title>Data Entry Forms</title>
<para>Once you have assigned a dataset to an geographic location that dataset will be made available in Data Entry (under Services) for the geographic locations you have assigned it to. A default data entry form will then be shown, which is simply a list of the data elements you belonging to the dataset together with a column for inputting the values. If your dataset contains data elements with a non-default category combination, such as age groups or gender then additional columns will be automatically generated in the default form based on the different options/dimensions. </para>
<para>If you use more than one data element category combination you will get multiple columns in the data entry form with different column headings for the options. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</para>
<section>
<title>Section forms</title>
<para>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table, both of these functions are supported in section forms. This function can be access by choosing Maintenance-&gt;Dataset Section. </para>

To add a new section to a section form, first choose the dataset from the &quot;Select dataset&quot; combo box. Then choose the specific category combo and press &quot;Add new&quot;. You can now add data elements from the &quot;Available data element&quot; list on the left to the &quot;Selected data elements&quot; list on the right. Data elements can be sorted within the section with the use of the &quot;Move up&quot; <inlinegraphic fileref="resources/images/FSNIS_images/move_up.png"/> and &quot;Move down&quot; <inlinegraphic fileref="resources/images/FSNIS_images/move_down.png"/> buttons.

<para>You can only use one data element category combination per section. </para>
</note></para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> You may need to control how the data element sections are displayed on the final form. In Dataset Section management, select the dataset from the &quot;Dataset&quot; drop-down box, then leave [All] in the &quot;Select Category Combo&quot; drop-down. Click on &quot;Sort section&quot; to sort the order of appearance of your sections in the data entry form.</para>

<para>Certain data elements may need to be disabled for data entry. Clicking on the <inlinegraphic fileref="resources/images/FSNIS_images/edit_layout.png"/> &quot;Section grey field management&quot; icon will allow you to disable specific data element category options as seen below. Pressing the &quot;Disable&quot; button will prevent data from being entered into this specific data element/category option during data entry.

<section id="customDataEntryForm">
<title>Custom Forms</title>
<para>When the form you want to design is too complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design. FSNIS uses a built-in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your HTML directly (using the Source window in the editor). A complete reference for use of the editor can be found <ulink url="http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide">here</ulink>.</para>
<para>One of the big advantages of custom forms, is that they can be created to mimic existing paper aggregation forms. This makes data entry much easier for users and should reduce the number of data elements which are incorrectly entered, as they are more easily identifiable when entering data from a paper form. </para>
<para>Once a custom form has been added to a dataset it will be available in data entry and used automatically. </para>
<note>
<para>Custom forms are preferentially displayed over section forms. If a dataset has both the section form and a custom form, the custom form will be displayed during data entry. Users will not be able to select which method they wish to input data, so be sure that your custom form contains all data elements which may be required.</para>
</note>
<para>To add a custom form design to a dataset then first locate your dataset in the Dataset Management window and click on the Design data entry form icon under Operations (the fifth icon), see the mouse-over text to be sure.</para>
<para>First provide a Name for the form. There are a few important buttons in the Editor that you must pay special attention to. The blue monitor icon is the full screen mode on/off button, which can be very useful. Then, there is a Source button that shows the HTML code for your form. </para>
<para>If you already have the HTML for your form then you should start by pasting it in here. Click on Source again to go back to preview/non-HTML mode. Then there is an icon in the top right corner with a + sign on it, this will open a list of available data elements to add to your form, the Data Element Selector window. </para>
<para>All the input fields need to have a link to a data element or indicator. To add new data elements to the form, double-click them from the data element/indicator box as shown below. You can also select a data element/indicator and press the &quot;+Insert&quot; button. You can switch between either data elements or indicators by pressing the respective buttons.</para>

<section id="ou_hierarchy">
<title>The geographic location hierarchy</title>
<para>The geographic location hierarchy defines the organisation structure of the FSNIS instance, such as how the food grain markets, administrative areas and other geographic areas are arranged with respect to each other. It is essentially the &quot;where&quot; dimension of FSNIS, similar to how periods represent the &quot;when&quot; or time dimension. Non-geographic hierarchies are discouraged and would better to be represented through the use ofgeographic location groups. This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g. Ministry of Food grain or a country) and any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called an  in FSNIS. </para>
<para>The design of this hierarchy will determine the geographic units of analysis available to the users as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one geographic location hierarchy at the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. </para>
<para>Additional hierarchies (e.g. parallel administrative boundaries to the food and nutrition sector) can be modelled using geographic location groups and group sets but the geographic location hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographic dimension. </para>
<para>The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations. For instance a country might have eight provinces and each province again might have a number of districts as their children. Normally the city/station (from which data is typically collected) will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. district/ greater district, so skewed geographic location trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5). </para>
<para>Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only problem is changing geographic locations that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g. splitting or merging food grain markets. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the geographic location structure. </para>
<important>
<para>Because the most recent information which is contained in the geographic location hierarchy is always used for aggregation, it is important to keep in mind that changes to it (such as the division of districts into two separate districts) will not be respected over time. As an example, District A may be sub-divided into District B and District C. This is a process which often happens for political reasons. stations which belong to District A would need to be reassigned to District B and C. However, any historical data, which was entered before the split actually occurred, would still be registered as belonging to District B and C and not the defunct District A. This temporal representation of the geographic location hierarchy across time will be lost. </para>

<title>geographic locations</title>
<para>This is where you can create geographic locations and build up the geographic location hierarchy. geographic locations are added one by one as either root unit or a child of a selected unit. The left side menu represents the current geographic location hierarchy and if you select a unit there you will see its children listed in the main list of geographic locations in the middle of the screen. When an geographic location is selected in the left side menu you can also add new child units to it. To locate a geographic location in the hierarchy you can either navigate through the tree by expanding the branches (click on the + symbol), or search for it by opening the search field (click the green symbol above the root of the hierarchy). In search you can either search for the geographic location name or its code, both will only show exact matches (case-insensitive). To add a new geographic location first select its parent and then click on the Add new button in the top right corner of the list of geographic locations. To add a new root geographic location make sure no geographic location is selected in the menu and click on &quot;Add new&quot;. The details of adding a new geographic location are explained in <xref linkend="editOrganisationalUnits"/>.</para>

<section id="ou_groupsets">
<title id="geographic locationGroupSets">geographic location group sets</title>
<para>Group sets can be understood as a flexible tool to add more categorisation to geographic locations. Any number of group sets can be added but as a default start all databases will have the two group sets &quot;Type&quot; and &quot;Ownership&quot;. Using these group sets will simplify how reporting is done, and facilitate analysis through the use of tools such as Excel PivotTables.</para>
<para>While a group set like &quot;Type&quot; describes a measure dimension, the actual categories are represented by the groups, and the categorisation of an geographic location through the geographic location&apos;s group memberships. This can be understood as a parallel hierarchy of geographic locations with the group set as the root (&quot;Type&quot;), the groups at level 2 (e..g &quot;Clinic&quot;, &quot;Hospital&quot;, &quot;Dispensary&quot;), and the actual geographic locations at level 3. The group set can as such provide additional information and dimensionality to the data analysis as data is easily filtered, organised, or aggregated by groups within a group set. </para>
<para>For this aggregation to work without any duplication in the data some rules are necessary. A group set is always exclusive, which means that an geographic location cannot be member of more than one group in a group set. Therefore, when creating a new geographic location, you will only be allowed to select a single geographic location group membership for each group set. Furthermore it is possible to define whether a group set is compulsory or not, which will affect the completeness of the data when analysing data using group sets. Compulsory means that ALL geographic locations must be member of a group in that group set. </para>
<para>We recommend that you approach the geographic location grouping in the following sequence (and one group set at a time):</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Define a new group set, such as &quot;Location&quot;. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Add new groups (such as &quot;Urban&quot;, &quot;Rural&quot; and &quot;Peri-urban&quot;). Once all groups have been defined, return to the geographic location group set and assign each of the desired groups to the group set.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Go back to each group, one by one, go to edit mode and assign the geographic locations that should be member of the group. Should you follow this route, you can place multiple geographic locations at a time in a group. However, you must be careful not to place the same geographic locations in two groups which itself is a member of an geographic location group set. This will result in a data integrity violation. If you have geographic location groups which are not exclusive, they should not be members of a group. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A better way to ensure that you do not assign a geographic location to multiple members of a group set by mistake is to use the edit feature of each geographic location to assign memberships to each group set.You will only be able to assign a single geographic location at a time however.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>It is important to keep in mind when using the &quot;Organisational unit group&quot; set function, that unless great care is taken, geographic locations can be assigned to multiple groups of a group set. This can be checked through the &quot;Data Integrity&quot; module, which will report which geographic locations are not members of a compulsory geographic location group set and which geographic locations have been assigned to more than one member of a group set. </para>

Note that assigning groups that will violate the exclusive rule on group sets is not possible, e.g. adding a group that already has assigned an geographic location that again is already member of a group that has already been selected by this group set, will not be possible since one geographic location will end up with two group memberships in the same group set. To avoid such situations we recommend first adding groups to group sets, and then geographic locations to groups.</para>

<title>Difference between Aggregated and market based data in a FSNIS</title>
<para>
<emphasis>Market based data</emphasis> is data relating to a single open market,
This data is typically based on a single open market. In an aggregate based system rather than a specific market, the focus is on a larger geographical location area like a district or a greater district.</para>
<para>
<emphasis>Aggregated data</emphasis> is the consolidation of data
relating to multiple markets and therefore cannot be traced back to a
specific reporting unit. Typically, the routine data that a Food grain
market deals with is this kind of aggregated statistics and is used
for the generation of routine reports and indicators, and most importantly, strategic planning within the Food grain system. Aggregate data cannot provide the type of detailed information which a market level data can, but is crucial for planning and guidance of the performance of Food grain systems. </para>
<para>Prices/ stocks data is confidential and therefore must be
protected so that no one other than the administrators can get it. When in paper,
it must be properly stored in a secure place. For computers, prices
data needs secure systems with passwords and restrained access.</para>

</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>As a first step, FSNIS serves as a data collection, recording and
compilation tool and all data (be it in numbers or text form) can be
entered into it. Data entry can be done in lists of data elements or in
customised user defined forms which can be developed to mimic paper based forms in order to ease the process of data entry.</para>
<para>As a next step, FSNIS can be used to increase data quality.
Firstly, at the point of data entry, a check can be made to see if data
falls within acceptable range levels of minimum and maximum values for
any particular data element. Such checking, for example, can help to
identify typing errors at the time of data entry. Further, user can
define various validation rules, and FSNIS can run the data through the
validation rules to identify violations.</para>
<para>When data has been entered and verified, FSNIS can help to make
different kinds of reports. The first kind are the routine reports that
can be predefined, so that all those reports that need to be routine
generated can be done on a click of a button. Further, FSNIS can help
in the generation of analytical reports through comparisons of for
example indicators across stations or over time. Graphs, maps, reports
and Food grain profiles are among the outputs that FSNIS can produce, and
these should routinely be produced, analysed, and acted upon by
managers.</para>
</section>
<section id="CH5_M5">
<title>Overview of FSNIS</title>
<section>
<title>Overview of FSNIS modules</title>
<para>FSNIS is based on a modular approach of design. A module can be
seen as an independent component of application that is capable of
both processing inputs as well as outputs, that is used to communicate
with other modules. The modules are flexible enough to allow changes
in one module without having any effect on other modules. As long as
input and output stays the same, it doesn&apos;t matter what happens inside
a module. A module can then be changed without affecting other
modules, which will be working as long as the output from the first
module comes out as normal. This modular feature allows FSNIS to be
constantly upgraded in terms of functionality, integrated with other
applications such as Excel pivot tables and GIS. Thus modularity
allows FSNIS to be flexible, and changes can take place in the
different modules without affecting others.</para>
<para>Currently, FSNIS has several modules for functions such as data
entry, data quality checks, report generation etc. These modules have
been categorised and presented under two core categories namely
Maintenance and Services. The Services module supports data record,
analysis, report generation etc. And the Maintenance module allows you
to set the content and structure of the Services module. Each of these modules will be discussed at greater length in this document. </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Web-based versus standalone FSNIS and their suitability</title>
<para>FSNIS can run both as a web based and offline application. As a
web based application, the FSNIS application can run on a central
server and make use of client-server architecture. For example, at the
state level, the FSNIS can run on a server, and the different
districts act as clients, drawing upon the server application through
the Internet for local use of the application.</para>
<para>In a standalone application, the FSNIS can run as an
independent application on individual computers in different sites
such as <abbrev>open market</abbrev>s, <abbrev>city</abbrev>s etc. So, if computerisation is taking place at the
District level, then the FSNIS will be installed separately on each of
the district level computers. The disadvantage of a standalone
application is that of platform dependency – where the application
needs to be configured to the platform on each of the respective
machines. A thick client requires a local run-time environment. For
example a Windows Form application will only run on a Windows platform
with the .Net framework installed. The major advantage of the offline
version is that it can run without any dependency on the Internet.
This allows the application to run in remote locations where there is
limited or no Internet connectivity.</para>
<para>The main advantage of a web based solution is that it is
centralised, which enables easy, on-line updating and deployment of the
application. The only requirements on the clients’ side are to have
web browser installed on the used computer and have an Internet
connection. The hardware on the server is often more powerful than the
single computer. Another advantage of the web application is that is
platform independent, allowing the same software to be accessed
through a web browser regardless of the client’s operating
system.</para>
<para>Where connectivity is available, and there is need for
centralised management, a web based application is useful, and a
standalone application is preferred when these conditions are not
available or required. However, in most cases, a mix of these two
approaches would be required, with a server based deployment working
for district-state-national level processing, and a standalone
deployment at lower levels where connectivity is limited. The
advantage of such an approach is that it is flexible, inclusive, and
scalable because as stations get Internet connectivity they can be
hooked up to the network.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS): benefits and challenges</title>
<para>Software carries the instructions that tell a computer how to
operate. The human authored and human readable form of those
instructions is called source code. Before the computer can actually
execute the instructions, the source code must be translated into a
machine readable (binary) format, called the object code. All
distributed software includes the object code, but <abbrev>FOSS</abbrev> makes the
source code available as well.</para>
<para>Proprietary software owners license their copyrighted object
code to a user, which allows the user to run the program. <abbrev>FOSS</abbrev>
programs, on the other hand, license both the object and the source
code, permitting the user to run, modify and possibly redistribute the
programs. With access to the source code, the users have the freedom
to run the program for any purpose, redistribute, probe, adapt, learn
from, customise the software to suit their needs, and release
improvements to the public for the good of the community. Hence, some
<abbrev>FOSS</abbrev> is also known as free software, where “free” refers, first and
foremost, to the above freedoms rather than in the monetary sense of
the word.</para>
<para>Within the Food grain and nutrition sector, <abbrev>FOSS</abbrev> can potentially have a
range of benefits, including:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Lower costs as it does not involve paying for prohibitive
license costs.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Given the information needs for the Food nutrition sector are
constantly changing and evolving, there is a need for the user to
have the freedom to make the changes as per the user requirements.
This is often limited in proprietary systems.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In the Food nutrition sector, a key agenda is
that of integration, which involves the technical linking of
different pieces of software. For
this, the source code needs to be made available to the developers
to create the integration. This availability is often not possible
in the case of proprietary software. And when it is, it comes at a
high cost and contractual obligations.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>FOSS applications like FSNIS typically are supported by a
global network of developers, and thus have access to cutting edge
research and development knowledge.</para>

<section>
<title>Understanding platform independence</title>
<para>All computers have an Operating System (OS) to manage it and the
programs running it. The operating system serves as the middle layer between the
software application, such as FSNIS, and the hardware, such as the
CPU and RAM. FSNIS runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and can therefore run on any operating system which supports Java. Platform
independence implies that the software application can run on ANY OS -
Windows, Linux, Macintosh etc. FSNIS is platform independent, and is
extremely useful in the context of public Food grain, where multiple operating systems may be in use. </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Auxiliary software that can be used with FSNIS</title>
<para>A variety of auxiliary software can be run with FSNIS, such as
GIS (for mapping), JasperReports (for reporting), Excel (for analysis through
pivot table operations), OpenMRS (for patient based management). Being based on Open Standards and an
Open Architecture, FSNIS can build bridges to speak to the other
systems. Further, auxiliary modules can be developed and integrated
with the core FSNIS application.</para>

<title>Prerequisites</title>
<para>You must be sure that you have a current version of the Java Runtime installed on your machine. Depending on your operating system, there are different ways of installing Java. The reader is referred to this <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">website</ulink> for detailed information on getting java installed.</para>

<title>Starting the FSNIS Live package</title>
<para>The FSNIS Live package is the easiest way to get started with FSNIS. FSNIS Live is appropriate for a stand-alone type of installation. Simply download the application from <ulink url="http://www.FSNIS.org/downloads">here</ulink>.
Once the file is downloaded, you can simply double-click the downloaded file, and get started using FSNIS. </para>
<section>
<title>Starting up with a blank database</title>
<para>The live package comes with a demo database just like what you see on the online demo (which is based on the national Sierra Leone HMIS), and if you want to start with a blank system/database and build up your own system then you need to do the following:
</para>
<para>1) Stop the FSNIS live if it is already running. Right click on the tray icon and select Exit.
The tray icon is the green symbol on the bottom right of your screen (on Windows) which should say&apos; FSNIS Server running&apos; if you hold your mouse pointer over it.</para>
<para>2) Open the folder where the FSNIS live package is installed and locate the folder called &quot;conf&quot;.
</para>
<para>3) In conf/ open the file called &apos;hibernate.properties&apos; in a text editor (notepad or similar) and do the following modification:
locate the string &apos;jdbc:h2:./database/FSNIS&apos; and replace the &apos;FSNIS&apos; part with any name that you want to give to your database (e.g. FSNIS_test).</para>
<para>4) Save and close the hibernate.properties file.
</para>
<para>5) Start FSNIS Live by double-clicking on the file FSNIS-live.exe in the FSNIS Live installation folder or by using a desktop shortcut or menu link that you might have set up.
</para>
<para>6) Wait for the browser window to open and the login screen to show, and then log in with username: admin and password: district
</para>
<para>7) Now you will see a completely empty FSNIS system and you should start by adding your users,geographic locationhierarchy, data elements, and datasets etc. Please refer to the other sections of the user manual for instructions on how to do this.
</para>

<title>Working directly with the H2 database</title>
<para>
FSNIS Live uses an embedded <ulink url="www.h2database.com/">H2</ulink> database. This has several advantages - there is no need
to install a separate database engine such as PostgresSql or MySql, and backup can be made by just copying the file. The whole db
exists in memory, which means high performance. The disadvantage is need for RAM. It is also not suitable for mulitiuser server
installations.
</para>
<para>
In general, it is recommended to work with the database through the FSNIS user interface, but in some situations one may need to
manipulate the data directly. If one downloads H2 separately, it comes with a web interface. It can also be manipulated using
<ulink url="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</ulink>, using the following procedure. This assumes that FSNIS-live is located in
the user&apos;s Linux home directory (represented by ~). Substitute the absolute path to your FSNIS-live installation.

<section id="mod2_2">
<title>Logging on to FSNIS</title>
<para>Regardless of whether you have installed the server version of the
desktop Live version, you will use a web-browser to log on to the
application. FSNIS should be compatible with most modern web-browsers,
although you will need to ensure that Java Script is enabled.</para>
<para>To log on to the application just enter <ulink url="http://localhost:8080/FSNIS" type="">http://localhost:8080/FSNIS</ulink> if you
are using the FSNIS live package, or replace local host with the name or IP
address of the server where the server version is installed.</para>
<para>Once you have started FSNIS, either on-line or offline, the displayed
screen will prompt you to enter your registered ‘user name’ and
‘password’. After entering the required information click on log-in button
to log into the application. The default user name and password are &apos;admin&apos; and &apos;district&apos;. They should be changed immediately upon logging on the first time. </para>

<title>Quick intro to designing a FSNIS database</title>
<para>The FSNIS application comes with a set of tools for data collection, validation, reporting and analysis, but the contents of the database, e.g. what to collect, who should collect it and on what format will depend on the context of use. This metadata need to be populated into the application before it can be used, and this can be done through the user interface and requires no programming or in-depth technical skills of the software. We call this initial process database design or customisation.</para>
<para>This section will provide a very quick and brief introduction to FSNIS database design and mainly explain the various steps needed to prepare a new FSNIS system for use. How to do each step is explained in other chapters, and best practices on design choices will be explained in an implementers manual (expected during first half of 2011). Here are the steps to follow:</para>
<para>1. Set up a geographic location hierarchy</para>
<para>2. Define data elements</para>
<para>3. Define data sets and data entry forms</para>
<para>4. Define validation rules</para>
<para>5. Define indicators</para>
<para>6. Define report tables and design reports</para>
<para>7. Set up the GIS module</para>
<para>8. Design charts and customise the dashboard</para>
<section>
<title>The geographic location hierarchy</title>
<para>The geographic location hierarchy defines the organisation using the FSNIS, the food grain markets, administrative areas and other geographic areas used in data collection and data analysis. This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit and any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called a geographic location in FSNIS. The design of this hierarchy will determine the geographic units of analysis available to the users as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one geographic location hierarchy at the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. Additional hierarchies (e.g. parallel administrative boundaries to the Food and nutrition sector) can be modelled using geographic location groups and group sets but the geographic location hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographic dimension. Typically national geographic location hierarchies have 4-6 levels but any number of levels is supported. The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations, e.g. a Country (the root) might have e.g. 8 parent units (provinces) and each province again ( at level 2) might have 10-15 districts as their children. Normally the food grain markets will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial markets so skewed geographic location trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5). Typically there is a geographic hierarchy defined. e.g. where the administrative offices are located (e.g. MoH, province, district) but often there are other administrative boundaries in the country that might or might not be added, depending on how its boundaries will improve data analysis. When designing the hierarchy the number of children for any geographic location may indicate the usefulness of the structure, e.g. having one or more 1-1 relationships between two levels is not very useful as the values will be the same for the child and the parent level. On the other extreme a very high number of children in the middle of the hierarchy (e.g. 50 districts in a province) might call for an extra level to be added in between to increase the usefulness of data analysis. The lowest level, the food grain markets will often have a large number of children (10-60), but for other levels higher up in the hierarchy approx. 5-20 children is recommended. To few or too many children might indicate that a level should be removed or added. Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only problem is changing geographic locations that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g. splitting or merging food grain markets. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the geographic location structure. Refer to the chapter on geographic locations to learn how to create geographic locations and to build up the hierarchy.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Data Elements</title>
<para>The Data Element is perhaps the most important building block of a FSNIS database. It represents the &quot;WHAT&quot; dimension, it explains what is being collected or analysed. In some contexts this is referred to an indicator but in FSNIS we call this unit of collection and analysis a <emphasis role="italic">data element</emphasis>. The data element often represents a count of something, and its name describes what is being counted, e.g. &quot;BCG doses given&quot; or &quot;Malaria cases&quot;. When data is collected, validated, analysed, reported or presented it is the data elements or expressions built upon data elements that describes the WHAT of the data. As such the data elements become important for all aspects of the system and they decide not only how data is collected, but more importantly how the data values are represented in the database, which again decides how data can be analysed and presented. </para>
<para>It is possible to add more details to this &quot;WHAT&quot; dimension through the disaggregation dimension called data element categories. Some common categories are Rice and production but any category can be added by the user and linked to specific data elements. The combination of a data element&apos;s name and its assigned category defines the smallest unit of collection and analysis available in the system and hence describes the raw data in the database. Aggregations can be done when zooming out of this dimension but no further drill-down is possible, so designing data elements and categories define the detail of the analysis available to the system (on the WHAT dimension). Changes to data elements and categories at a later stage in the process might be complicated as these will change the meaning of the data values already captured in the database (if any). So this step is one of the more decisive and careful steps in the database design process.</para>
<para>One best practice when designing data elements is to think of data elements as a unit of data analysis and not just as a field in the data collection form. Each data element lives on its own in the database, completely detached from the collection form, and reports and other outputs are based on data elements and expressions/formulas composed of data elements and not the data collection forms. So the data analysis needs should drive the process, and not the look an feel of the data collection forms. A simple rule of thumb is that the name of the data element must be able to stand on its own and describe the data value also outside the context of its collection form. E.g. a data element name like &quot;Production&quot; makes sense when looking at it in either the &quot;ANNUAL OUTPUT&quot; form or the &quot;FOODGRAIN PRICE&quot; form, but on its own it does not uniquely describe the phenomena (what is being produced?), and should in stead be called &quot;Total Annual Rice Boro Production&quot; In a database or a repository of data elements this context is no longer valid and therefore the names of the data elements become so important in describing the data. </para>
<para>Common properties of data elements can be modelled through what is called data element groups. The groups are completely flexible in the sense that they are defined by the user, both their names and their memberships. Groups are useful both for browsing and presenting related data, but can also be used to aggregate data elements together. Groups are loosely coupled to data elements and not tied directly to the data values which means they can be modified and added at any point in time without interfering with the raw data. </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Datasets and data entry forms</title>
<para>All data entry in FSNIS is organised through the use of Datasets. A Dataset is a collection of data elements grouped together for data collection, and in the case of distributed installs they also define chunks of data for export and import between instances of FSNIS (e.g. from a district office local installation to a national server). Datasets are not linked directly to the data values, only through their data elements and frequencies, and as such a dataset can be modified, deleted or added at any point in time without affecting the raw data already captured in the system, but such changes will of course affect how new data will be collected. </para>
<para>A dataset has a period type which controls the data collection frequency, which can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly. Both which data elements to include in the dataset and the period type is defined by the user, together with a name, short name, and code.</para>
<para>In order to use a dataset to collect data for a specific geographic location you must assign the geographic location to the dataset, and this mechanism controls which geographic locations that can use which datasets, and at the same time defines the target values for data completeness (e.g. how many food grain markets in a district expected to submit market price data every month). </para>
<para>A data element can belong to multiple datasets, but this requires careful thinking as it may lead to overlapping and inconstant data being collected if e.g. the datasets are given different frequencies and are used by the same geographic locations.
</para>
<section>
<title>Data entry forms</title>
<para>Once you have assigned a dataset to an geographic location that dataset will be made available in Data Entry (under Services) for the geographic locations you have assigned it to and for the valid periods according to the dataset&apos;s period type. A default data entry form will then be shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the dataset together with a column for inputting the values. If your dataset contains data elements with categories such as age groups or gender, then additional columns will be automatically generated in the default form based on the categories. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</para>
<section>
<title>Section forms</title>
<para>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table (e.g. some categories do not apply to all data elements), both of these functions are supported in section forms. After defining a dataset you can define it&apos;s sections with subsets of data elements, a heading and possible grey fields in the section&apos;s table. The order of sections in a dataset can also be defined. In Data Entry you can now start using the Section form (should appear automatically when sections are available for the selected dataset). You can switch between default and section forms in the top right corner of the data entry screen. Most tabular data entry forms should be possible to do with sections forms and the more you can utilise the section forms (or default forms) the easier it is for you. If these two types of forms are not meeting your requirements then the third option is the completely flexible, although more time-consuming, custom data entry forms.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Custom Forms</title>
<para>When the form you want to design is too complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design. In FSNIS there is a built in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your html directly (using the Source window in the editor. In the custom form you can insert static text or data fields (linked to data elements + category) in any position on the form and you have complete freedom to design the layout of the form. Once a custom form has been added to a dataset it will be available in data entry and used automatically. You can switch back to default and section (if exists) forms in the top right corner of the data entry screen. </para>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Validation rules</title>
<para>Once you have set up the data entry part of the system and started to collect data then there is time to define data quality checks that help to improve the quality of the data being collected. You can add as many validation rules as you like and these are composed of left and right side expressions that again are composed of data elements, with an operator between the two sides. Typical rules are comparing subtotals to totals of something. E.g. if you have two data elements &quot;Urea bought&quot; and &quot;Urea spent&quot; then you know that in the same form (for the same period and geographic location) the Urea spent must always be equal or lower than the Urea bought. These rules should be absolute rules meaning that they are mathematically correct and not just assumptions or &quot;most of the time correct&quot;. The rules can be run in data entry, after filling each form, or as a more batch like process on multiple forms at the same time, e.g. for all markets for the previous reporting month. The results of the tests will list all violations and the detailed values for each side of the expression where the violation occurred to make it easy to go back to data entry and correct the values.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Indicators</title>
<para>Indicators represent perhaps the most powerful data analysis feature of the FSNIS. While data elements represent the raw data (counts) being collected the indicators represent formulas providing rates, production per unit area, ratios and other formula-based units of analysis. An indicator is made up of a factor (e.g. 1, 100, 100, 100 000), a numerator and a denominator, the two latter are both expressions based on one or more data elements. E.g. the indicator &quot;wheat retail price &lt;1 year&quot; is defined a formula with a factor 100, a numerator (&quot;average of high and low wheat price&quot;) and a denominator (&quot;1&quot;). </para>
<para>Most report modules in FSNIS support both data elements and indicators and you can also combine these in custom reports, but the important difference and strength of indicators versus raw data (data element&apos;s data values) is the ability to compare data across different geographic areas (e.g. highly populated vs rural areas) as the target population can be used in the denominator.</para>
<para>Indicators can be added, modified and deleted at any point in time without interfering with the data values in the database. </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Report tables and reports</title>
<para>Standard reports in FSNIS is a very flexible way of presenting the data that has been collected. Data can be aggregated by any geographic location or geographic location level, by data element, by indicators, as well as over time (e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly). The report tables are custom data sources for the standard reports and can be flexibly defined in the user interface and later accessed in external report designers such as iReport or BIRT. These report designs can then be set up as easily accessible one-click reports with parameters so that the users can run the same reports e.g. every month when new data is entered, and also be relevant to users at all levels as the geographic location can be selected at the time of running the report.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>GIS</title>
<para>In the integrated GIS module you can easily display your data on maps, both on polygons (areas) and as points (food grain markets), and either as data elements or indicators. By providing the coordinates of your geographic locations to the system you can quickly get up to speed with this module. See the GIS section for details on how to get started. </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Charts and dashboard</title>
<para>One of the easiest way to display your indicator data is through charts. An easy to use chart dialogue will guide you through the creation of various types of charts with data on indicators,geographic locations and periods of your choice. These charts can easily be added to one of the four chart sections on your dashboard and there be made easily available right after log in. Make sure to set the dashboard module as the start module in user settings. </para>

<title>User management</title>
<para>FSNIS allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a define set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</para>

<title>Using Data Visualizer</title>
<section id="dvIntro">
<title>Data Visualizer overview</title>
<para>The data visualizer module enables users to easily create dynamic data analysis and visualizations through charts and data tables. You can freely select content (like indicators, periods and geographic locations) for your analysis. This module can be accessed by going to &quot;Services - Data Visualizer&quot; in the main menu. The image below shows the view port of the module. For a quick start:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para> Look under the &quot;Indicator&quot; heading and select an indicator group from the list of groups. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Look under &quot;Available indicators&quot; and select a few indicators from the list by double-clicking on them.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Click &quot;Update&quot; in the top bar and see the chart unfold.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>The data visualizer is designed firstly to be easy-to-use - you can simply select the indicators, data elements, periods and geographic locations you want to include and click &quot;Update&quot; to get your visualization. Secondly it is designed to be fast and work well over poor Internet connections - charts are generated in the web browser and very little data is transferred over the Internet.</para>

</section>
<section id="dvSeriesCategoryFilter">
<title>Selecting series, category and filter</title>
<para>This section lets you define which dimension of the data you want to appear as series, category and filter. This asks for a closer explanation. Dimension in this regard refers to the elements which describe the data values in the system. We have three main dimensions in the system:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Data: Includes data elements and indicators, describing the phenomena or event of the data.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Periods: Describes when the event took place.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>geographic locations: Describes where the event took place.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>The visualization module lets you use these dimensions completely flexible in terms of appearing as series, categories and filter. Understanding these concepts is most easily done by looking at the screen shot from the opening page below: </para>

</screenshot>
<para>More formally this can be described as following:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Series: A series is a set of continuous, related elements (eg. periods or data elements) which you want to visualize in order to emphasize trends or relations in its data.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Categories: A category is a set of elements (e.g. indicators or geographic locations) for which you want to compare its data.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Filter: Since most charts are two-dimensional, a filter must be used on the third dimension in order to use only a single element for the chart to become meaningful.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</section>
<section>
<title>Selecting indicators and data elements</title>
<para>The visualizer module can display any number of indicators and data elements in a chart and data table. Both indicators and data elements can be selected and appear together in the same chart. You can select indicators by clicking at the &quot;Indicators&quot; header and selecting an indicator group from the list of groups below it. This will make the indicators in the selected group appear in the list under &quot;Available indicators&quot; to the left. From that list you can double click on any indicator in order to select it, this will move it to the list under &quot;Selected indicators&quot;. Alternatively you can mark one or more indicators and click the single-arrow button. To select all indicators you simply click on the double-arrow button. To deselect indicators you can do correspondingly in the &quot;Selected indicators&quot; list.</para>
<para>To select data elements click on the &quot;Data elements&quot; header. The same principle for selecting and deselecting applies as for indicators.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Selecting periods</title>
<para>To select periods click on the &quot;Periods&quot; header. You can select any number of periods from the set of periods listed under the header, such as &quot;Last month&quot;, &quot;Months this year&quot; and &quot;Last 5 years&quot;. The names should be fairly self-descriptive. All periods are relative to the current date, meaning that if the current month is March and you select &quot;Last month&quot;, the month of February will be included in the chart.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Selecting geographic locations</title>
<para>You can select which geographic locations to include in the chart by clicking on the &quot;geographic locations&quot; header. This section features a tree including all geographic locations in the system. You can select any of the geographic locations by clicking on them. If you want to select multiple, arbitrary geographic locations you can press the Ctrl button and then click away in the tree. If you want to include all geographic locations existing directly under a specific geographic location (the children of the parent geographic location in other terms) you can right-click on the geographic location and select &quot;Select all children&quot;.</para>

<title>Indicators</title>
<para>Indicators are composed of multiple data elements and typically consist of a numerator and a denominator. Indicators are never entered in FSNIS but instead calculated from the raw data registered in the system, based on the indicator formulas. Indicators are used to calculate i.e. production rates, percent increase, ratios and other calculated values which are more useful for data analysis than the raw data described by data elements. </para>
<para>To access the Indicator maintains page, press Maintenance -&gt; Data Element and Indicators -&gt; Indicator from the main FSNIS menu. You can add, delete, modify and view extra information about the indicators in the system using the icons next to each indicator in the list.</para>

All you need to do is selecting your desired indicator/dataelement-period-map combination, then the geographic location level and finally the parent to define the boundary. If your database has coordinates for these geographic locations they will appear on the map.</para>
<para>You may choose between legend types: <guimenuitem>automatic</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>predefined</guimenuitem>. Automatic means that the application will create a legend set for you based on your what method, number of classes, low color and high color you select. Method alludes to the size of the legend classes. Set to <guimenuitem>Equal intervals</guimenuitem> they will be “highest map value – lowest map value / number of classes”. Set to <guimenuitem>Equal group count</guimenuitem> the legend creator will try to distribute the geographic locations evenly. Choose <guimenuitem>Fixed bounds </guimenuitem>and you may define your own class break values, type e.g. “20,40,60” using a comma to separate each of them. The legend will appear as an even gradation from the start color to the end color. Predefined legend sets are described in <xref linkend="gisLegendSet"/> .</para>
<para>Low radius and high radius only have effect on points (stations) and decides the the circle radius for points with the lowest and highest value.</para>
<para>The map view combo box lists all map views (favorites) saved by the user. The settings that are stored in the map view is automatically applied to the thematic map panel. Favorite map views are described in<xref linkend="gisFavoriteMapView"/> .</para>

<title>Using reporting functionality</title>
<section id="reporting_intro">
<title>Reporting functionality in FSNIS</title>
<para>The reporting module in FSNIS provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section will explain how to use them to view and analyse data. Another section explains how to configure and set up the various reporting tools.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Standard reports:</emphasis> Standard reports are built on report tables but are more advanced in its design allowing for more cosmetics and styles. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF files which makes them ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. </para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Dataset reports:</emphasis> Dataset reports are simply a printer friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either raw or aggregated data (over time or place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports. This will work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Dashboard:</emphasis> The fastest way to view your data. The dashboard can display up to four updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favourite reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Data Visualizer:</emphasis> Do flexible visualizations of your data as charts and data tables. Any number of indicators and data elements can be included. Several chart types are available such as column, stacked column, line, area and pie charts. The charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal dashboard. Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer. </para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Report tables:</emphasis> These are very configurable table outputs of your data, either showing raw or aggregated data, as well as indicator data. These tables are used as either a data source for more advanced reports, for export to external systems or as a crude report itself and are exportable to pdf, excel, csv and jasper design files. These tables represent a very dynamic, flexible and quick way to look at the data. Report tables can be set up with parameters to make them reusable over time and place.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">geographic location distribution reports:</emphasis> These reports are generated off the geographic location group set information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of food grain markets that are located in a given area (any level in the hierarchy). These reports are automatically generated and display the information in both tables and charts and downloads in pdf, excel, and csv are available.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Reporting rate summary:</emphasis> These reports provide a nice overview of how many stations that have submitted their data for a given dataset and period. Here you can get both the counts and the percentages showing the reporting rate for all or single data sets.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Excel pivot tables:</emphasis> Excel pivot tables represents a very powerful way to analyse your data and FSNIS links directly to the pivot tables so that all the data will be available and updated in your Excel file. This can be a very useful tool for users that prefer working with the data offline. To update your local pivot tables you need the myDatamart tool which connects to the online server and downloads the latest data. This update will typically take place once a month when new data is available but do not require a constant internet connection like the other reporting tools (if you are connecting to an online FSNIS server).</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Web-based pivot tables:</emphasis> The built in pivot table tool is a simple web-based tool to display indicator data by geographic location and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for some basic pivoting manipulations of the tables. It is a quick and easy way to look at many indicator values at the same time (by geographic location and/or period) but does not have the same functionality as the offline Excel pivot tables. </para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">GIS:</emphasis> Present and analyse your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators and given that you have coordinates for all your geographic locations you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country polygons to station points. See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built into FSNIS and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your geographic locations and the maps will be available.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">Report parameters:</emphasis> Most report tables have parameters which means that you can filter which geographic locations and/or periods you want in the report. This makes the reports much more reusable. When you run the report table a Report parameter window will open and ask the user to input values for the selected parameters. The possible parameters are Reporting Month and geographic location and either one of these or both will show in the window. After selecting the values click on the Get Report button.</para>

<para>To start entering data the first step is to open the correct form. Follow these steps:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para> Locate the geographic location you want to register data for in the tree menu to the left. Expand and close branches by clicking on the +/- symbols. A quick way to find an geographic location is to use the search box just above the tree (the green symbol), but you need to write in the full name to get a match.</para>

<para>Simply start entering data by clicking inside the first field and type in the value. Move to the next field using the Tab button. Shift+Tab will take you back one step. The values are saved immediately and do not require any save/finished button click. A green field indicates that the value has been saved in the system (on the server). On a slow connection it might take some time before the values are saved. </para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Input validation:</emphasis> If you type in an invalid value, e.g. a character in a field that only accepts numeric values you will get a pop-up that explains the problem and the field will be coloured yellow (not saved) until you have corrected the value. If you have defined a min/max range for the field (data element+geographic location combination) a pop-up message will notify you when the value is out of range, and the value will remain unsaved until you have changed the value (or updated the range and then re-entered the value). </para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Disabled fields:</emphasis> If a field is disabled (grey) it means that the field should not be filled. The cursor will automatically jump to the next open field. </para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Data history:</emphasis> By double-clicking on any input field in the form a data history window opens showing the last 12 values registered for the current field (geographic location+data element+categoryoptioncombo) in a bar chart.

<title>Offline data entry</title>
<para> The data entry module will function even if during data entry the Internet connectivity is not stable. In order to utilize this functionality, you must login to the server while the Internet is functional, but if during data entry, the Internet link between your computer and the server becomes unstable, data can still be entered into the data entry form, saved to your local computer, and then pushed to the server once the Internet connectivity has been restored. Data can be entered
and stored locally while being offline and uploaded to the central
server when on-line. This means that the on-line deployment strategy
will be more viable in areas with unstable Internet connectivity. The
total bandwidth usage is greatly reduced since forms no longer are
retrieved from the server for each rendering.</para>

<title>Data dimensions in FSNIS</title>
<section id="C14_M1">
<title>The core building blocks describing the data</title>
<para>A data value in FSNIS (core module for aggregated data) is at minimum described by three dimensions, 1) data element, 2) geographic location, and 3) period, which also forms the core building blocks of the data model. E.g. if you want to know how many Aus Rice was produced in District Gopalganj in December 2009, the three dimensions to that value are the Data Element &quot;Aus Rice monthly production&quot;, the geographic location &quot;District Gopalganj&quot;, and the Period &quot;Dec-09&quot;. All data values have at least these three dimensions describing What, Where and When.</para>

<title>Data element group sets</title>
<para>While the data element categories and their options described above dictated the level of detail (disaggregation) at the point of data collection and how data values get stored in the database, the data element group sets and groups can be used to add more information to data elements after data collection. E.g. if looking at a lot of data elements at the same time in a report you would want to group these based on some criteria, e.g. if looking at all the data captured in a form for Agricultural credit and Commodity import you might want to separate or group data elements along a Commodity dimension (called group set) where &quot;Agricultural credit&quot; (or CIP) and &quot;Commodity import&quot; would be the two groups. Expanding the report to include data from other programs or larger themes of Food grain data would mean more groups to such a group set dimension, like &quot;Fertilizers&quot;, &quot;Production&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;. For this example you would create a data element group set called &quot;Commodity&quot; (or whatever name you find appropriate), and to represent the different Commodity in this dimension you would define data elements groups called &quot;CIP&quot;, &quot;Nutrition&quot;, &quot;Agricultural Credit&quot;, &quot;Production&quot; and so on, and add all these groups to the &quot;Commodity&quot; group set. To link or tag the data element &quot;Aus Rice Production&quot; to such a dimension you must (in our example) add it to the &quot;CIP&quot; group. Which groups you add &quot;Agricultural Credit&quot; to does not affect how food grain markets collect the data but adds more possibilities to your data analysis. So for the group set dimensions there are three levels; the group set (e.g. &quot;Commodity&quot;), the group (e.g. &quot;CIP&quot;), and the data element (e.g. &quot;Aus Rice Production&quot;).</para>
<para>Indicators can be grouped into indicator groups and further into indicator group sets (dimensions) in exactly the same way as data elements.</para>

<title>The geographic location dimension</title>
<para>geographic locations in FSNIS can be either any type of food grain market like Community Food grain Centres or stations or an administrative unit like &quot;Ministry of Food&quot;, &quot;Division Barisal&quot; or &quot;Greater District Barisal&quot;. geographic locations are represented in a default hierarchy following the Food grain system at large, and are therefore assigned a geographic location level. E.g. Bangladesh has these levels; National, Division, Greater District and  District, City and Station and all geographic locations are linked to one of these levels. An geographic location hierarchy in FSNIS can have any number of levels. Normally data is collected at the lowest level, at the stations and then data values are linked to individual stations. When designing reports at higher levels with data aggregated by chiefdom or district, the FSNIS will use the hierarchy structure to sum up all the food grain markets&apos; data for any given unit at any level. The geographic location level capturing the data always represents the lowest level of detail that is possible to use in data analysis, and the geographic location levels define the available levels of aggregation along a geographic dimension.</para>
<section>
<title>geographic location group sets and groups</title>
<para>While station is the lowest geographic level for disaggregation in FSNIS there are ways to flexibly group geographic locations into any number of dimensions by using the group sets and groups functionality. E.g. if all stations are given an official type like City, District, etc. it is possible to create a geographic location group set called &quot;geographic location type&quot; and add groups with the names of the types mentioned above. Then you can link your geographic locations to their corresponding groups (geographic location types). Other common geographic location dimensions are Rural/Urban (Rural, Urbal, Peri-urban), and Ownership (Public, Private. NGO etc.). When analysing data from the Station level it then becomes possible to aggregate data by these dimensions, e.g. look at Aus production in Barisal district by the type of Station in stead of the Stations themselves.</para>
<section>
<title>Alternative geographic location hierarchies - advanced use of group sets and groups</title>
<para>A more advanced use of geographic location group sets and groups is to create alternative hierarchies e.g. use administrative borders from other ministries.</para>

<title>Best practice on the use of group sets and groups</title>
<para>Groups that are not members of group sets are more or less useless for analysis (should we allow this at all?). With all the groups you get by e.g. including all different diagnoses as groups the full list of groups does not makes sense in any pivot table, and you easily get duplicates in your pivot tables since data elements or indicators are members of multiple groups. This can be controlled by the use of group sets. So the recommendation is to assign all your groups to a group set, and then you pull the group sets you need into your reports and analysis. </para>
<para>It is also recommended to have one group set that is used for the major organising of all data in e.g. a pivot table, e.g use Food grain programs or other larger themes for data elements or indicators that together cover all the data. That will provide a nicely organised overview of all your raw data or indicator data.</para>
<para>The resource table gives all groupsets as columns with groups as rows, and 1 DE per row.
This means that all groupsets are joined in when e.g. creating a view to a pivot table. Resource tables have to be generated from the Maintenance-&gt;Data Administration-&gt;Resource Table window, and more information on this is available in a later chapter called Data Administration in FSNIS or from the online help text in that window.

<title>The time (period) dimension</title>
<para>The period dimension becomes an important factor when analysing data over time e.g. when looking at cumulative data, when creating quarterly or annual aggregated reports, or when doing analysis that combines data with different characteristics like monthly routine data, annual production/ procurement data or six-monthly fertilizer data.</para>
<section>
<title>Period Types</title>
<para>In FSNIS the periods are organised according to a set of fixed period types: 1) Daily, 2) Weekly, 3) Monthly, 4) Quarterly, 5) Six-monthly, 6) Yearly, 7) Two-yearly, and 8) a special period type called Relative.

</para>
<para>As a rule of thumb all geographic locations should collect the same data using the same frequency or periodicity, so first of all the periods play an important role in standardising data collection across the country. A data entry form therefore needs to know its period type to make sure data is always collected according to the correct and same periodicity across the country. </para>
<para>It is possible however to collect the same data elements using different period types by assigning the same data elements to multiple data sets with different period types, however then it becomes crucial to make sure no geographic location is collecting data using both data sets/period types as that would create overlap and duplication of data values. If set up correctly the aggregation service in FSNIS (through datamart and report tables) will aggregate the data together, e.g. the monthly data from one part of the country with quarterly data from another part of the country into a national quarterly report. For simplicity and to avoid data duplication we strongly advice to use the same period type for all geographic locations for the same data elements when possible. </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Relative periods</title>
<para>When creating reports within the FSNIS (report tables, standard reports, charts) it is possible to make use of the relative periods functionality. The simplest scenario is when you want to design a monthly report that can be reused every month without having to make changes to the report template to accommodate for the changes in period. The relative period called reporting_month allows for this, and the user can at the time of report generation through a report parameter select the month to use in the report. </para>
<para>A slightly more advanced use case is when you want to make a monthly summary report for procurement and want to look at the data from the current (reporting) month together with a cumulative value for the year so far. The relative period called &quot;So far this year&quot; provides such a cumulative value relative to the reporting month selecting when running the report. Other relative periods are the last 3,6, 9 or 12 months periods which are cumulative values calculated back from the selected reporting month. If you want to create a report with data aggregated by quarters (the ones that have passed so far in the year) you can select &quot;Individual quarters this year&quot;. Other relative periods are described under the reporting table section of the manual. Common for all the relative periods is that they are relative to a selected reporting month. Even quarterly or annual reports need to know their reporting month to derive the year, the quarter and so on. The reporting month then becomes one of the report parameters the users have to select when running a report based on relative periods.</para>

<title>Aggregation of periods</title>
<para>While data needs to be collected on a given frequency to standardise data collection and management, this does not put limitations on the period types that can be used in data analysis and reports. Just like data gets aggregated up the geographic location hierarchy, data is also aggregated according to a period hierarchy, so you can create quarterly and annual reports based on data that is being collected on a Monthly basis. The defined period type for a data entry form (data set) defines the lowest level of period detail possible in a report.</para>
<section>
<title>Sum and average aggregation along the period dimension</title>
<para>When aggregating data on the period dimension there are two options for how the calculation is done; 1) sum and 2) average, which is specified per data element in the FSNIS through the use of the &apos;aggregation operator&apos; attribute in the Add/Edit Data Elements window.

</para>
<para>Most of the data collected on a routinely basis should be aggregated by summing up the months or weeks, e.g. you create a quarterly report on Aus Production by summing up the three monthly values for &quot;Aus Production&quot;.

</para>
<para>Other types of data that are more permanently valid over time like &quot;Number of markets in the Station&quot; or an annual production estimate of &quot;Annual Production&quot; need to be aggregated differently. These values are static for all months as long as there are valid data. E.g. the estimated annual production calculated from the previous years data is the same for all months in a year or the number of open markets in a Station is the same for every month in the 6 months period the number is reported for.

</para>
<para>This difference e.g. becomes important when calculating an annual value for the indicator for a Station. The monthly data elements are summed up for the 12 months to get the annual score while the number of markets for the Station is calculated as the average of the two 6-monthly values reported through the 6-monthly market report. 
</para>
<para>Another important feature of average data elements is the validity period concept. Average data values are standing values for any period type within the borders of the period they are registered for. E.g. an annual production estimate following the calendar year will have the same value for any period that falls within that year no matter what the period type.

<title>Data collection vs. data analysis</title>
<section>
<title>Data collection and storage</title>
<para>The datasets determine what raw data that is available in the system as they describe how data is collected. Through the data sets we define the building blocks of the data to be captured and stored in the FSNIS. For each data dimension we decide what level of detail the data should be collected on; 1) the data element (e.g. offtake,import or any event taking place) and its categories (e.g. type and brand), 2) the period/frequency dimension, and 3) the geographic location dimension. For any report or data analysis you can never retrieve more detailed data than what is defined in the datasets so the design of the datasets and their corresponding data entry forms (the data collection tools) dictate what kind of data analysis that will be possible.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Input != Output</title>
<para>It is important to understand that the data entry forms or datasets themselves are not linked to the data (values) and that the meaning of data (the What) is only described by the data element (and its categories). This makes it perfectly safe to modify datasets and forms without altering the data (as long as the data elements stay the same). This loose coupling between forms and data makes FSNIS flexible when it comes to designing and changing new forms and in providing exactly the form the users want. </para>
<para>Another benefit of only linking data to data elements and not to forms is the flexibility of creating indicators and validation rules based on data elements, and also in providing any kind of output report (in pivot tables, charts, maps etc) that can combine data individually or across forms, e.g. to correlate data from different Food grain programs. Due to this flexibility of enabling integration of data from various programs (forms) and sources (routine and semi permanent (production, sale, fertilizers)) a FSNIS database is used as an integrated data repository for many or all parts of the aggregated data in a larger system. The figure below illustrates this flexibility.</para>

<title>From paper for to multidimensional datasets - lessons learned</title>
<para>Typically the design of a FSNIS dataset is based on some requirements from a paper form that is already in use. The logic of paper forms are not the same as the data element and data set model of FSNIS, e.g. often a field in a tabular paper form is described both by column headings and text on each row, and sometimes also with some introductory table heading that provides more context. In the database this is captured in one atomic data element with no reference to a position in a visual table format, so it is important to make sure the data element with the optional data element categories capture the full meaning of each individual field in the paper form. </para>
<para>Another important thing to have in mind while designing datasets is that the dataset and the corresponding data entry form (which is a dataset with layout) is a data collection tool and not a report or analysis tool. There are other far more sophisticated tools for data output and reporting in FSNIS than the data entry forms. Paper forms are often designed with both data collection and reporting in mind and therefore you might see things such as cumulative values (in addition to the monthly values), repetition of annual data (the same population data reported every month) or even indicator values such as rates in the same form as the monthly raw data. When you store the raw data in FSNIS every month and have all the processing power you need within the computerised tool there is no need (in fact it would be stupid and most likely cause inconsistency) to register manually calculated values such as the ones mentioned above. You only want to capture the raw data in your datasets/forms and leave the calculations to the computer, and presentation of such values to the reporting tools in FSNIS.</para>

<title id="dashboard_messages">Messages and feedback</title>
<para>FSNIS has certain functions to facilitate communication between different users and user groups. This type of communication is important to facilitate feedback regarding data quality, timeliness of submissions, or to simply answer a question which a particular user may have. </para>
<para>Feedback messages are sent to a particular group of users and can be sent by all users who have access to the dashboard module. In order to enable the receipt of feedback messages sent from the dashboard, you must set the system setting &quot;Feedback recipients&quot; which is available from the Maintenance-&gt;System settings dialog. Be sure to define a user group (e.g &quot;Feedback recipients&quot;) with all of the users who should receive feedback messages. Refer to the section in this manual on &quot;User groups&quot; for more information of how to do this. Once the &quot;Feedback recipients&quot; user group has been defined, each time a feedback message is sent, it will appear as a message in each of the &quot;Feedback recipients&quot; message queue within FSNIS. Note that messages will not be sent to users email addresses, but will only appear within the FSNIS application. </para>
<para>To send a new feedback message, simply select &quot;Write feedback&quot; from the dashboard. Provide a subject and text in the respective text boxes. The message will appear in all of the specified users message queue. </para>
<para>Messages can be sent to specific groups of users who have been assigned to particular geographic locations. To write a new message, simply click &quot;Messages&quot; from the dashboard screen and then press the &quot;Write message&quot; button.. Select an geographic location (or group of geographic locations) from the &quot;Recipients&quot;geographic location tree. Provide a Subject and Text. To send the message, press the &quot;Send&quot; button. You can discard the message by pressing the &quot;Discard&quot; button as seen in the screenshot below.</para>

<section>
<title>Data elements without groups</title>
<para>Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups.

<section>
<title>Data elements violating exclusive group sets</title>
<para>
Some data elements have been allocated to several data element groups that are members of the same data element group set. All group sets in FSNIS are defined as exclusive, which means that a data element can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> data element group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Data element groups to review each data element identified in the integrity check. Either remove the data element from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types</title>
<para>Data Elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets. </para>

<title>geographic locations without groups</title>
<para>All geographic locations <emphasis>must</emphasis> be allocated to at least <emphasis>one</emphasis> group. The problem might either be that you have not defined any `compulsory` geographic location Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the `compulsory` rule for some geographic locations . NOTE: If you have defined no `compulsory` geographic location Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to Maintenance -&gt; geographic locations-&gt;geographic location group sets and define at least one `compulsory` Group Set (the group set `geographic locationType` are nearly universally relevant). If you have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -&gt; geographic location Groups to review each geographic location identified and add the relevant Group allocation.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>geographic locations violating compulsory group sets</title>
<para>These geographic locations have not been assigned to the any geographic location group within one of the <emphasis>compulsory</emphasis> geographic location group sets. When a group set is defined as `compulsory`, it means that a geographic location must be allocated to at least one geographic location group within that group set. For instance, all geographic locations must belong to one of the groups in the `geographic locationType` group set. It might belong to the `Open market` or the `District` or any other `type` group - but it must belong to exactly one of them. Go to Maintenance -&gt; geographic location-&gt;geographic location groups to review each geographic location identified in the integrity check. Allocate all geographic locations to exactly one group. </para>

<section id="dataArchive">
<title>Data Archive</title>
<para>The purpose of the data archive function is to move data which is currently not being used for analysis to a secondary storage location in order to improve performance of the application. Data can be both archived and unarchived. When archiving data one moves it from the primary storage to the secondary storage location, while unarchiving moves it from the secondary storage location to the primary. Analysis functionality in FSNIS heavily utilizes queries to the data value database table, and by reducing the size of this table these operations will be significantly faster. Typically one would want to archive data that is older than two years.</para>
<para>To archive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be archived. Then press the archive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
<para>To unarchive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be unarchived. Then press the unarchive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
<para>In some cases you might end up with overlapping data. For instance one might archive data for a given timespan, then later enter data for a period in that timespan.

called &quot;Delivery type&quot; where &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Breach&quot;, &quot;Caesarian&quot; and
&quot;Assisted&quot; would be the options. This option set can later be
associated with any number of data elements. When doing data entry in
name-based records module those elements will then appear in the form
as drop-down lists with auto-completion support.
</para>

<section id="cacheStatistics">
<title>Cache Statistics </title>
<para>This option is for system administrators only to use. The cache statistics shows the status of the application level cache. The application level cache refers to the objects and query results that the application is caching in order to speed up performance. If the database has been modified directly the application cache needs to be cleared for it to take effect.</para>

<title>Dynamic attributes</title>
<para>Dynamic attributes can be used to add additional information to certain objects (namely data elements, indicators, geographic locations and users). In addition to the standard attributes each of these objects have, it may be required in certain installations to have additional attributes, such as a fax number which is associated with an geographic location. To add a new dynamic attribute to an object, select &quot;Maintenance-&gt;Data administration&quot; from the main menu, then &quot;Attribute&quot; from the left side panel, and press the &quot;Add new&quot; button.</para>

<title>Designing a data set</title>
<section id="C17_M1">
<title>From paper to multidimensional datasets - lessons learned</title>
<para>Typically the design of a FSNIS dataset is based on some requirements from a paper form that is already in use. The logic of paper forms are not the same as the data element and data set model of FSNIS, e.g. often a field in a tabular paper form is described both by column headings and text on each row, and sometimes also with some introductory table heading that provides more context. In the database this is captured in one atomic data element with no reference to a position in a visual table format, so it is important to make sure the data element with the optional data element categories capture the full meaning of each individual field in the paper form. </para>
<para>Another important thing to have in mind while designing datasets is that the dataset and the corresponding data entry form (which is a dataset with layout) is a data collection tool and not a report or analysis tool. There are other far more sophisticated tools for data output  and reporting in FSNIS than the data entry forms. Paper forms are often designed with both data collection and reporting in mind and therefore you might see things such as cumulative values (in addition to the monthly values), repetition of annual data (the same production estimate data reported every month) or even indicator values such as production rates in the same form as the monthly raw data. When you store the raw data in FSNIS every month and have all the processing power you need within the computerised tool there is no need (in fact it would be stupid and most likely cause inconsistency) to register manually calculated values such as the ones mentioned above. You only want to capture the raw data in your datasets/forms and leave the calculations to the computer, and presentation of such values to the reporting tools in FSNIS.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Correctness:</emphasis> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that station. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</para>

<para>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element over the last six months or as defined by the user.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Defining various validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and Geographical Location(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Analysis of data sets, i.e. examining gaps in data.</para>

</section>
<section>
<title>Data quality check at the point of data entry </title>
<para>Data quality can be checked at the point of data entry through setting the minimum and maximum value range for each element manually or generating the min-max values using the FSNIS if there is historical data available for that data element.
</para>
<section>
<title>Setting the minimum and maximum value range manually </title>
<para>If you are using the default entry screen click on the element for which you want to set the min-max value. A pop-up window will appear in which you can enter the vaules. On subsequent data entry if the value entered does not fall within the set min-max range the text box will change colour to red. The user will also get a pop-up as shown below. This change in colour is a prompt to check the data entered and make necessary correction. On the data entry screen the users also have the option to add a comment on how the discrepant figure might be explained (if required). This you can do by using the drop down menu of the ‘comment’ box. In case you are using the custom data entry screen which is displayed when you deselect the ‘default data entry form’ option on the top right corner of the screen. In this case the minimum and maximum values can be added by double-clicking on the data entry box instead of the data element.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Generated min-max values </title>
<para>It is possible to generate the min-max value, element-wise, using the FSNIS. In such case you merely need to click on the ‘Generate min-max’ button near the upper right corner. In case of default data entry screen the min and max values, when generated, will appear on the left and right side of the data entry box. In case you deselect the default data entry form the generated values will appear on the top right end of the screen.</para>

<section id="validationRule">
<title>Validation Rule</title>
<para>This module provides management of validation rules. A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met. For instance, a validation rule could assert that the total sale of wheat  is less than or equal to the total sum of production and procurement</para>
<para>To add a validation rule, click the add new button. First, provide a descriptive <emphasis role="italic">name</emphasis> for the validation rule. The name must be unique among the validation rules. Second, provide a description for the validation rule. Third, select an operator. The operator options are <emphasis role="italic">equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">not equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">greater than</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">greater than or equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less than</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less than or equal to</emphasis>. Then define the left side and right side of the validation rule expression. First, provide a description for the expression. Second, build the expression with the expression builder. The expression is mathematical and contain data elements as well as integers and mathematical operators. Data elements can be included by double-clicking one in the available data elements list to the righ. Alternatively one can select a data element and click the insert button. Mathematical operators can be included by clicking the corresponding button under the expression builder area. Save the expression by clicking <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>, then save the validation rule by clicking <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>.</para>
<para>To edit a validation rule, click the <emphasis role="italic">edit</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list. Then follow the same procedures as above.</para>
<para>To delete a validation rule, click the <emphasis role="italic">delete</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list.</para>
<para>To view validation rule details, click the <emphasis role="italic">view details</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list.</para>
</section>
<section id="validationRuleGroup">
<title>Validation Rule Group</title>
<para>A validation rule group provides a mechanism for classifying related data elements. Another advantage of using validation rule groups is that it can later be run separately, contrary to running all validation rules.</para>

<para>Effective use of data element categories greatly simplifies the process of setting up the FSNIS system, as the data element categories can be reused to disaggregate many different data elements. Otherwise, each of the data elements listed above, would need to be created separately.

<title>Data dictionaries</title>
<para>Data dictionaries are used to group data elements and indicators during filtering operations. They are useful for combining related groups of data elements and indicators according to the programs to which they belong. For instance a data dictionary called &quot;Fertilizers&quot; could be created, and all Urea, TSP, MP, DAP data elements and indicators could be added to the dictionary.

<title>Types of data and aggregation</title>
<para>In the bigger picture all data in FSNIS are usually called aggregated as they are aggregates (e.g. monthly summaries) of production records or some kind of sale reports reported from the food grain markets. Aggregation inside FSNIS however, which is the topic here, is concerned with how the raw data captured in FSNIS (through data entry or import)are further aggregated over time (e.g. from monthly to quarterly values) or up the geographic location hierarchy (e.g. from station to district values).

<title>Basic rules of aggregation</title>
<section>
<title>What is added together</title>
<para>Data (raw) can be registered at any geographic location level. This varies form country to country but FSNIS is flexible in allowing data entry or data import to take place at any level. This means that geographic locations that themselves have children can register data, sometimes the same data elements as their children units. The basic rule of aggregation in FSNIS is that <emphasis>all raw data is aggregated together</emphasis>, meaning data registered at a station on level 5 is added to the data registered for a District at level 4.</para>
<para>
It is up to the user/system administrator/designer to make sure that no duplication of data entry is taking place and that e.g. data entered at level 4 are not about the same services/visits that are reported by geographic location children at level 5. NOTE that in some cases you want to have duplication of data in the system but in a controlled manner. E.g. when you have two different sources of data for population estimates, both level 5 catchment population data and another population data source for level 4 based on census data (because sum of level 5 catchments is not always the same as level 4 census data). Then you can specify using advanced aggregation settings (see further down) that the system should e.g. not add level 5 population data to the level 4 population data and that level 3,2,1 population data aggregates are only based on level 4 data and does not include level 5 data.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>How data gets added together</title>
<para>How data is aggregated depends on the dimension of aggregation (see further down).</para>
<para>Along the geographic location level dimension data is always summed up, simply added together. Note that raw data is never percentages, and therefore can be summed together. Indicator values that can be percentages are treated differently (re-calculated at each level, never summed up).</para>
<para>
Along the time dimension there are several possibilities, the two most common ways to aggregate are sum and average. The user can specify for each data element which method to use by setting the aggregation operator (see further down). Monthly service data are normally summed together over time. More details further down under &apos;aggregation operators&apos;. 
</para>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Dimensions of aggregation</title>
<section>
<title>Geographical locations and levels</title>
<para>Geographical locations are used to represent the &apos;where&apos; dimension associated with data values. In FSNIS,geographic locations are arranged in a hierarchy, which typically corresponds to the hierarchical nature of the organisation or country.geographic location levels correspond to the distinct levels within the hierarchy. For instance, a country may be organized into divisions, provinces, then districts, then stations. This geographic location hierarchy would have five levels. Within each level, a number of geographic locations would exist. During the aggregation process, data is aggregated from the lower geographic location levels to higher levels. Depending on the aggregation operator, data may be &apos;summed&apos; or &apos;averaged&apos; within a given geographic location level, to derive the aggregate total for all the geographic locations that are contained within a higher level geographic location level. For instance, if there are ten districts contained in a division and the aggregation operator for a given data element has been defined as &apos;SUM&apos;, the aggregate total for the division would be calculated as the sum of the values of the individual ten districts contained in that division.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Period</title>
<para>Periods are used to represent the &apos;when&apos; dimension associated with data values. Data can easily be aggregated from weeks to months, from months to quarters, and from quarters to years. FSNIS uses known rules of how these different intervals are contained within other intervals (for instance Quarter 1 2010 is known to contain January 2010, February 2010 an March 2010) in order to aggregate data from smaller time intervals, e.g. weeks, into longer time intervals, e.g. months. </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Data Elements and Categories</title>
<para>The data element dimension specifies &apos;what&apos; is being recorded by a particular data value. Data element categories are actually degenerated dimensions of the data element dimension, and are used to disaggregate the data element dimension into finer categories. Data element categories, such as &apos;offtake&apos; and &apos;procurement&apos;, are used to record a particular data element, typically for different population groups. These categories can then be used to calculate the overall total for the category and the total of all categories. </para>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Aggregation operators, methods for aggregation</title>
<section>
<title>Sum</title>
<para>The &apos;sum&apos; operator simply calculates the sum of all data values that are contained within a particular aggregation matrix. For instance, if data is recorded on a monthly basis at the district level and is aggregated to provincial quarterly totals, all data contained in all districts for a given province and all weeks for the given quarter will be added together to obtain the aggregate total.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Average</title>
<para>When the average aggregation operator is selected, the unweighted average of all data values within a given aggregation matrix are calculated. </para>
<para>It is important to understand how FSNIS treats null values in the context of the average operator. It is fairly common for some geographic locations not to submit data for certain data elements. In the context of the average operator, the average results from the number of data elements that are actually present (therefore NOT NULL) within a given aggregation matrix. If there are 12 districts within a given division, but only 10 of these have submitted data, the average aggregate will result from these ten values that are actually present in the database, and will not take into account the missing values. </para>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Advanced aggregation settings (aggregation levels)</title>
<section>
<title>Aggregation levels</title>
<para>The normal rule of the system is to aggregate all raw data together when moving up the geographic location hierarchy and the system assumes that data entry is not being duplicated by entering the same services provided to the same clients at both station level and also entering an &apos;aggregated&apos; (sum of all stations) number at a higher level. This is to more easily facilitate aggregation when the same services are provided but to different clients/catchment populations at stations and a district (the parent of the same stations). In this way a station at level 5 and a district at level 4 can share the same data elements and simply add together their numbers to provide the total of services provided in the geographic area.</para>
<para>Sometimes such an aggregation is not desired, simply because it would mean duplicating data about the same population. This is the case when you have two different sources of data for two different geographic location levels. E.g. catchment population for stations can come from a different source than district populations and therefore the sum of the station catchment populations do not match the district population provided by e.g. daily data. If this is the case we would actually want duplicated data in the system so that each level can have as accurate numbers as possible but then we do NOT want to aggregate these data sources together.
</para>
<para>In the Data Element section you can edit data elements and for each of them specify how aggregation is done for each level. In the case described above we need to tell the system NOT to include station data on production in any of the aggregations above that level, as the level above, in this case the districts have registered their production directly as raw data. The district population data should then be used at all levels above and including the district level, while station level should use its own data.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>How to edit data element aggregation</title>
<para>This is controlled through something called aggregation levels and at the end of the edit data element screen there is a tick-box called Aggregation Levels. If you tick that one you will see a list of aggregation levels, available and selected. Default is to have no aggregation levels defined, then all raw data in the hierarchy will be added together. To specify the rule described above, and given a hierarchy of Country, Division, District, station: select station and District as your aggregation levels. Basically you select where you have data. Selecting station means that stations will use data from stations (given since this is the lowest level). Selecting District means that the District level raw data will be used when aggregating data for District level (hence no aggregation will take place at that level), and the station data will not be part of the aggregated District values. When aggregating data at Division level the District level raw data will be used since this is the highest available aggregation level selected. Also for Country level aggregates the District raw data will be used. Just to repeat, if we had not specified that District level was an aggregation level, then the station data and district data would have been added together and caused duplicate (double) population data for districts and all levels above.</para>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Data mart</title>
<para>The purpose of the data mart is to provide pre-processed data to external data analysis and reporting tools. The data mart consists of two tables, aggregated data values and aggregated indicator values in the FSNIS database. The values in the data mart are aggregated versions of the raw data found in the data value table as well as calculated indicator values. Aggregation can take place over time (e.g. from monthly data to aggregated quarterly values), or along the geographic location hierarchy levels (e.g. from Station data to aggregated district totals). The data mart can store all kinds of such aggregated values. The data mart is as such just a processed &apos;copy&apos; of the data values and it can be emptied and regenerated at any time, and the tables are read only tables. The meta data in the two data mart tables are referenced by internal identifiers, such as data element id, geographic location id which refer to the tables like data element and geographic location, see &apos;How to make use of the data mart in external tools&apos; for more on this. </para>
<section>
<title>The data mart export process</title>
<para>The FSNIS Data Mart handles the aggregation of data across multiple dimensions (geographic location hierarchy, geographic location group hierarchy, time, etc) and can be controlled through this interface. Select the geographic location levels which should be aggregated, the start date and end date, and press &quot;Start export&quot;. The data mart process will be executed in the background, and a full report of the export process will be updated regularly so that you can determine the state of the process. See the section on &quot;Scheduling&quot; in the data administration module for information on how this process can be triggered to run automatically.</para>

<section>
<title>Data element categories in the data mart</title>
<para>Each data value for a data element has a reference to a category option combo, which is a combination of the disaggregations for the data value, e.g. (male,&lt;5y) or (In Station, &lt;1y). These disaggregations are exported as they are to the data mart, and no aggregation is done on this dimension. See the data elements section for more on data element categories and the resource tables section for more information on how to do aggregation on these categories.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Adding new data to an existing data mart</title>
<para>When you add new data to an existing data mart the new values will be appended to the existing so that the data mart grows for each new process if new selections (such as new periods) have been made. If any of the selected values are already in the data mart, then the old will be replaced by the newly generated values. </para>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Resource tables</title>
<para>Resource tables provide additional information about the dimensions of the data in a format that is well suited for external tools to combine with the data mart tables. By joining the data mart with these resource tables one can easily aggregate along the data element category dimension or data element/indicator/geographic location groups dimensions. See the Pivot Tables section for more examples of how these can be used.

geographic location structure is another important table in the database that helps to provide the hierarchy of geographic locations together with the data. By joining the geographic location structure table with the data mart tables you can get rows of data values with the full hierarchy, 

This format makes it much easier for e.g. pivot tables or other OLAP tools to aggregate data up the hierarchy.
</para>
</section>
<section id="reportTable">
<title>Report tables</title>
<para>Report tables are defined, cross-tabulated reports which can be used as the basis of further reports, such as Excel Pivot Tables or simply downloaded as an Excel sheet. Report tables are intended to provide a specific view of data which is required, such as &quot;Monthly Production Indicators&quot;. This report table might provide all Production indicators for a country, aggregated by month for the entire country. This data could of course be retrieved from the main datamart but report tables generally perform faster and present well defined views of data to users. </para>
<important>
<para> It is therefore important to keep in mind that when the aggregation strategy of the system is set to &quot;Batch&quot;, the data for each report table must also be present in the data mart. </para>

<section>
<title>How to create report tables</title>
<para>To create a new report table, go to the Report tables section of the Reports module (Reports -&gt; Report Table). Above the list of standard reports, use the &quot;Add report table&quot; or &quot;Add Dataelement Dimension Table&quot; buttons. A regular report table can be used to hold data on data elements, indicators or dataset completeness, while Dataelement dimension tables are used to include data element categories in report tables. Creating the tables are done in the same way, however, the only exception being when choosing data.</para>
<para>To create a report table, you start by making some general choices for the table, the most important of which is the cross tab dimension. Then, you choose which data elements, indicators, datasets or data element dimensions you want to include. Finally you select which geographic locations and time periods to use in the report table. Each of these steps are described in detail below.</para>

<para>There are two ways to select both what geographic locations to include in a report, and what time periods should be included: relative, or fixed. Fixed geographic locations and/or periods means that you select the units/periods to include in the report table when you create the report table. Using relative periods, you can select the time and/or units as parameters when the report table is populated, for example when running a standard report or creating a chart. A combination is also possible, for example to add some geographic locations in the report permanently while letting the users choose additional. Report parameters is discussed below. In general, using fixed geographic locations and/or time periods are an unnecessary restriction.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Fixed geographic locations</emphasis></para>
<para>To add fixed geographic locations, click &quot;Toggle fixed geographic locations&quot;. A panel will appear where you can choose geographic locations to always include in the report. If you leave it blank, the users select geographic locations when running the report through the use of report parameters. Use the drop down menu to filter geographic locations by level, double click or use the buttons to add/remove.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Fixed Periods</emphasis></para>
<para>To add fixed periods, click &quot;Toggle fixed geographic locations&quot;. A panel will appear where you can choose periods to always include in the report. If you leave it blank, the users select periods when running the report through the use of report parameters. Use the drop down menu to choose period type (week, month, etc), the Prev and Next button to choose year, and double click or use the buttons to add/remove.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Relative periods</emphasis></para>
<para>Instead of using fixed/static periods like &apos;Jan-2010&apos; or &apos;Q1-2010&apos;, more generic periods can be used to create reusable report tables, e.g. for monthly reports the period &apos;Reporting month&apos; will simply pick the current reporting month selected by the user when running the report. Note that all relative periods are relative to a &quot;reporting month&quot;. The reporting month is either selected by the users, otherwise the current month is used. Here is a description of the possible relative periods:

</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Reporting month:</emphasis></para>
<para>Use this for monthly reports. The month selected in the reporting month parameter will be used in the report.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Months/Quarters this year</emphasis>: </para>
<para>This will provide one value per month or quarter in the year. This is well suited for standard monthly or quarterly reports where all month/quarters need to be listed. Periods that still have no data will be empty but will always keep the same column name.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">This year:</emphasis> </para>
<para>This is the cumulative so far in the year, aggregating the periods from the beginning of the year up to and including the selected reporting month.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Months/Quarters last year</emphasis>: </para>
<para>This will provide one value per month or quarter last year, relative to the reporting month. This is well suited for standard monthly or quarterly reports where all month/quarters need to be listed. Periods that still have no data will be empty, but will always keep the same column name.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Last year:</emphasis> </para>
<para>This is the cumulative last year, relative to the reporting month, aggregating all the periods from last year.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Example - relative periods</emphasis></para>
<para>Let&apos;s say we have chosen three indicators: A, B and C, and we have also chosen to use the relative periods &apos;Reporting month&apos; and &apos;This year&apos; when we created the report table. If the reporting month (selected automatically or by the user) is for example May 2010, the report table will calculate the values for the three selected indicators for May 2010 (= the &apos;Reporting month&apos;) and the accumulated values for the three selected indicators so far in 2010 (= so far &apos;This year&apos;).</para>
<para>Thus, we will end up with six values for each of the geographic locations: &quot;Indicator A May 2010&quot;, &quot;Indicator B May 2010&quot; &quot;Indicator C May 2010&quot;, &quot;Indicator A so far in 2010&quot;, &quot;Indicator B so far in 2010&quot; and &quot;Indicator C so far in 2010&quot;.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Report parameters</emphasis></para>
<para>Report parameters make the reports more generic and reusable over time and for different geographic locations. These parameters will pop up when generating the report table or running a report based on the report table. The users will select what they want to see in the report. There are four possible report parameters and you can select none, all, or any combination.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Reporting month:</emphasis> </para>
<para>This decides which month will be used when the system is choosing the relative periods. If the box it not checked, the user will not be asked for the reporting month when the report is generated - the current month will then be used.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Grand parent geographic location:</emphasis> </para>
<para>Select the grand parent of all the geographic location children and grand children you want listed in the report. E.g. a selected region will trigger the use of the region itself, all its district and all their sub-districts.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Parent geographic location:</emphasis> </para>
<para>Select the parent of all the geographic location children you want listed in the report. E.g. a selected district will trigger the use of the district itself and all its children/sub-districts.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="italic">geographic location:</emphasis> </para>
<para>This triggers the use of this geographic location in the report. No children are listed.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Example - report parameters</emphasis></para>
<para>Continuing with the example on relative periods just above, let&apos;s say that in addition to &apos;Reporting month&apos;, we have chosen &apos;Parent geographic location&apos; as a report parameter when we created the report table. When we&apos;re running the report table, we will be asked to select an geographic location. Now, let&apos;s say we choose &quot;Region R&quot; as the geographic location. &quot;Region R&quot; has the children &quot;District X&quot; and &quot;District Y&quot;.</para>
<para>When the report is run, the system will aggregate data for both &quot;District X&quot; and &quot;District Y&quot;. The data will be aggregated from the lowest level where they have been collected. The values for the districts will be aggregated further to give an aggregated value for &quot;Region R&quot;.</para>
<para>Thus, the report table will generate the six values presented in the previous example, for &quot;District X&quot;, &quot;District Y&quot; and &quot;Region R&quot;.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Data element dimension tables</title>
<para>These tables enable the use of data element categories in report tables. There are two differences from regular report tables. The first is that it is not possible to select cross tab dimensions, as the columns will always be the disaggregations from the category combinations. The other is the actual choice of data. Only one category combination can be added per report and only data elements from the same category combo can be selected. </para>
<para>Subtotals and the total will also be included in the table,

<title>Report table - best practices</title>
<para>To make the report tables reusable over time and across geographic locations they can have parameters. Four types of parameters are allowed; geographic location, parent geographic location (for listing of geographic locations in one area), grand parent geographic location and reporting month. As a side note it can be mentioned that we are looking into expanding this to include reporting quarter and year, or to make that period parameter more generic with regard to period type somehow. The ability to use period as a parameter makes the report table reusable over time and as such fits nicely with report needs such as monthly, quarterly or annual reports. When a report is run by the user in FSNIS, the user must specify the values for the report tables that are linked to the report. First the report table is re-generated (deleted and re-created with updated data), and then the report is run (in the background, in Jasper report engine).

</para>
<para>Report tables can consist of values related to data elements, indicators or data completeness, which is related to completeness of reporting across geographic locations for a given month. Completeness reports will be covered in a separate section.</para>
<para>There are three dimensions in a report table that identify the data; indicators or data elements, geographic locations and periods. For each of these dimensions the user can select which metadata values to include in the report. The user must select one or more data elements or indicators to appear in the report. The geographic location selection can be substituted with a parameter, either one specific geographic location or an geographic location parent (making itself and all its children appear in the report). If one or more geographic locations are selected and no geographic location parameter is used, then the report is static with regard to which geographic locations to include, which in most cases is an unnecessary restriction to a report.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Using relative periods</emphasis></para>
<para>The period selection is more advanced as it can in addition to specific periods like Jan-09, Q1-08, 2007 also contain what is called relative periods. As report usually is run routinely over time a specific period like Jan-09 is not very useful in a report. Instead, if you want to design a monthly report, you should use the relative period called Reporting Month. Then you must also include Reporting Month as one of your report parameters to let the system know what exactly is the Reporting Month on the time of report generation. There are many other relative periods available, and they all relate to the report parameter Reporting Month. E.g. the relative period called So far this year refers to the accumulative value for the year incl. the Reporting Month. If you want a trend report with multiple periods in stead of one aggregated period, you can select e.g. &apos;Months this year&apos;, which would give you values for each month so far in the year. You can do a similar report with quarters. The idea is to support as many generic report types as possible using relative periods, so if you have other report needs, please suggest new relative periods on the mailing list, and they might be added to the report table options.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Cross-tabbing dimensions</emphasis></para>
<para>Cross tabbing is a very powerful functionality in report design, as the typical FSNIS data table with references to period, data element/indicator and geographic location makes more advanced report design very difficult, as you cannot put e.g. specific indicators, periods or geographic locations on specific columns. E.g. by cross-tabbing on the indicator dimension in an indicator report table you will get the indicator names on the column headers in your report, in addition to a column referencing geographic location, and another column referencing period. With such a table design you could drag and drop indicator names to specific columns or chart positions in the iReport software. Similarly you can cross tab on geographic locations or periods to make their names specifically available to report design. E.g. by cross-tabbing on periods and selecting the two relative periods &apos;Reporting month&apos; and &apos;This year&apos;, you can design reports with both the last month and the accumulative annual value for given month as they will be available as column headers in your report table. It is also possible to combine two dimensions in cross-tabbing, e.g. period and indicator, which makes it possible to e.g. look at three selected indicators for two specific relative periods.  

</para>
<para>All in all, by combining the functionality of cross tabbing, relative periods and report table parameters you should have a tool to support most report scenarios. If not, we would be very happy to receive suggestions to further improvements to report tables. As already mentioned, we have started to look at more fine-grained parameters for the period dimension as the &apos;Reporting month&apos; does not cover enough, or at least is not intuitive enough, when it comes to e.g. quarterly reports.

<para>A standard report is a manually designed report that presents manually chosen data in a manually specified layout. Still, it&apos;s highly flexible, as it can be designed to be reused over and over again, by making use of the powerful report tables.</para>
<para>A standard report can present any value from any table in the FSNIS database, but for the report design, we want the reports to be flexible, so we want to connect the reports to tables that changes through time. The report tables are therefore ideal for the report design.</para>

<title>Designing Standard reports in iReport</title>
<para>Jasper iReport Designer is a tool for creating reports that can be used as Standard Reports in FSNIS. The tool allows for the creation of standard report templates that can easily be exported from FSNIS with up to date data. The process of creating reports involves four major steps:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>A report table must be created in FSNIS with the indicators/data elements/datasets to be used in the report.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You have to run the report table and download the design file (Click the &quot;Download as JRXML&quot; button).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Open the downloaded .jrxml file using the free software Jasper iReport Designer to edit the layout of the report.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The edited report can then be uploaded to FSNIS to be used as a standard report.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>If you want to preview your report during the design in iReport, you actually have to upload your file to FSNIS to see how it looks.</para>
<para>These four steps will be describe in detail in the coming sections. In general, when you are making standard reports you should have a clear idea of how it should look before you even make the report table, as how the report table is designed has implications for how the report can be formatted in iReport. For example, what crosstab dimensions are selected in the report table has consequences for what crosstabs are available for the standard report, and it has consequences for what types of charts you can make.</para>
<section>
<title>Download and open the design file</title>
<para><emphasis>Note: If you have not created a report table yet, you have to do so. See section &quot;How to create report tables&quot; to do so.</emphasis></para>
<para>Locate your desired report table and run it by clicking the green circle with a white arrow inside. When the report is shown, click the &quot;Download as JRXML&quot; button to download the design file. Then open that file in the Jasper iReport Designer software.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Editing the report</title>
<para>You are now ready to edit the layout of the report. The main iReport window consists of a &quot;Report Inspector&quot; to the left, the report document in the middle, a &quot;Palette&quot; area on the upper right hand side and a &quot;Properties&quot; area on the lower right hand side. The &quot;Report Inspector&quot; are used for selecting and examining the various properties of the report, and when selecting an item in the inspector, the &quot;Properties&quot; panel changes to display properties relating to the selection. The &quot;Palette&quot; is used for adding various elements, e.g. text boxes, images and charts to the document. 
</para>

</screenshot>
<para><emphasis>Note: If you cannot see the Palette or Properties sidebar, you can enable them from the menu item called &quot;Window&quot; on the menu bar.</emphasis></para>
<para>The iReport document is divided into seven main bands, divided by layout separators (the blue lines). These lines are used to decide how big each of the areas should be on the report. 
</para>
<para>The areas all have different purposes:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Title - area for the title of the report</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Page header - area for the page header</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Column header - area for column headers (for the table)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Detail 1 - area where the actual report data will be placed</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Column footer - area to make footer of the table</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Page footer - area for the page footer</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Summary - elements in this area will be placed at the end of the report</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>By default you will see that only the Title, Column Header and the Detail 1 bands have data.
For most reports this is OK. The Title band is suitable for a title and e.g. a chart. 
Data fields entered into the Detail 1 area will be iterated over to create a table. 
For example, if a field called &quot;dataelementname&quot; is placed in the Detail 1 band,
all data elements in the report table will be listed here. 
We&apos;ll come back to data fields management just a little below.</para>
<para>The unused bands in the report are shrinked to add more space for your report data. You can
however increase/decrease the band height as you like. There are two ways to do that. The first way is simply to drag the blue band-line as shown below.</para>

<para>The other way to adjust the band height is to select a band in the 
&quot;Report Inspector&quot;, and then adjust the &quot;Band height&quot; value in the 
&quot;Detail 1 - properties&quot; area in the lower right corner.</para>

<para>As the fields are already present on the report, you probably don&apos;t want to do anything
than just fix the layout and drag fields around. You can also resize the fields by dragging the side, top or bottom lines. If you want to change the text in the column headers, you simply double click the field and change the text.</para>
<para>To add the a field to the table, we simply drag it to the Detail 1 band from the &quot;Report Inspector&quot;. The column header will be added automatically.</para>
<para>By double clicking the box, the text can be edited. The format of the text, such as size, font and alignment, can be adjusted with the tools above the document.</para>

<title>Text</title>
<para>
There are two types of text in iReport: «Text labels» and «Text fields» (data fields). They work in different ways, and should be used for different purposes. The main point is that text fields are just place holders that will be filled with the correct text from the report table when the report is run, while text labels will stay the way they are when the report is run.</para>

<title>Text fields</title>
<para>Text fields are formulas that will be filled from the report table when the report is run. Unlike static text, these can not be edited in a normal way. However, they can be manipulated in various ways to ensure that the desired output will be produced. There are three ways to edit the text fields:</para>
<para/>
<itemizedlist>

<para>By right clicking on the text box and selecting Edit expression</para>
</listitem>

<para>By double clicking the text field (not recommended, as this will not bring up the expression editor)</para>

<para>Text fields can represent either numbers or text, so that they can be used both for showing for example names of district or for numeric values. It is therefore important the the Expression class, seen in the Text field properties matches the Text field expression. For the default text fields in the .jrxml file downloaded from FSNIS this is not a problem, but it is important when making new text fields. The two most important Expression classes are java.lang.Double for numbers and java.lang.String for text.</para>
<para/>
<section>
<title>Example</title>
<para>For example, let us say you have a quarterly report where you would like to add a new column with the yearly total. You therefore add a new Static text field to the column header band, and a Text field to the details band in. By default, new Text fields are set to java.lang.String (text). However, the yearly total column will be filled with numbers. We therefore have to change the Expression class for the new text field to java.lang.Double:</para>

<title>Filtering the table rows</title>
<para>In the default table exported from FSNIS, there are some rows that it might be better to leave out of the table, and some that it would be preferable to have at the end. For example, when making a table based on a report table with the «parent geographic location» parameter, the default table might have a row with the national level somewhere in between all the regions. In iReport, this can be changed so that the «parent geographic location» appears at the bottom of the table. This involves two steps that will be explained below. Note that this will not work where there is only one geographic location and it is therefore most useful when using the «parent geographic location» or «grand parent geographic location» parameters in the report table.</para>
<section>
<title>Hiding the «parameter geographic location» from the table</title>
<para>We exclude the &quot;parameter geographic location&quot; from the table by using a property in the Details band called &quot;Print when expression&quot;. To set a Print when expression, start by selecting the Detail band in the Report inspector, then edit the Print when expression in the properties panel.</para>

<para>The Expression editor window should now appear. What we must do is to create an expression that checks if the row being generated is the row with the geographic location given as a parameter. The report table contains a column that we can use for this called organisation_unit_is_parent. To exclude the row with the parameter geographic location, double click on organisation_unit_is_parent in the list to copy it to the expression area, then add <command>.equals(&quot;No&quot;)</command> at the end so that the code is:</para>
<para><command>$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals(&quot;No&quot;)</command></para>
<para>This tells the report engine to only print table rows where the geographic location is not the parent geographic location.</para>

<title>Putting the &quot;city Dhaka geographic location&quot; at the bottom of the table</title>
<para>Instead of removing the &quot;City Dhaka geographic location&quot; from the table entirely, it is also possible to put it at the bottom (or top) of the table. This is done by using the sort functionality explained in the next section, and choosing to sort first by &quot;geographic_location_is_parent&quot;. Other sorting options can be added in addition to this, for example to make a list where the City Dhaka geographic location is at the bottom of the table, with the other geographic locations listed alphabetically above it.

<para>Using the expression editor it is also possible to exclude other rows from the table, in addition to the parent geographic location as was explained above. This can also be excluded from the table using the Print when expression that was introduced above. To to this, follow the instructions above to bring up the Expression editor window. Then, we use Java expressions to test whether or not the row should be hidden.</para>
<section>
<title>Example - removing rows with geographic locations starting with [</title>
<para>Example - removing rows with geographic locations starting with [</para>
<para><command>($F{geographiclocationname}.charAt( 0 ) != &apos;[&apos;)</command></para>
<para>This makes the report skip any rows where the first character of the geographic location name is [.</para>
<para>It is also possible to combine several of these expressions. To do this we put the expressions in a parenthesis with the two characters &amp;&amp; in between. For example, to make a table that leaves both geographic locations whose name starts with [ and the parent geographic location, we can use the following expression:</para>
<para><command>($F{geographiclocationname}.charAt( 0 ) != &apos;[&apos;)&amp;&amp;$F{geographic_location_is_parent}.equals(&quot;No&quot;)</command></para>

<title>Changing indicator/data element names</title>
<para>By default, the reports from FSNIS uses the short names for indicators and data elements in reports and charts. In some cases these are not always very meaningful for third parties but with some work they can be given custom names through iReport. This is useful for example if you are making a report with indicators as rows and periods as column, or for charts with indicators. </para>

<title>Adding horizontal totals</title>
<para>By using the expression editor, it is possible to add a column to the table with totals for each row. In the following example, we will make a table with three months as columns as well as a column with the totals for the three months.</para>
<para>We start by dragging a text label into the table header and changing its text to &quot;Total&quot;, and dragging a text field into the details row. </para>
<para>As was discussed in the section on &quot;Text field&quot;, we have to change the properties of the new text field so that it can display numbers. To do this, change the &quot;Expressions Class&quot; in the properties panel to &quot;java.lang.Double&quot;.</para>
<para>Right click the text field and choose &quot;Edit Expression&quot;. This will bring up the &quot;Expressions editor&quot;. As the expression, we want to sum up all the columns. In this case we have three value expressions we want to sum up: &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October 2010&quot;, &quot;November 2010&quot;. The name of these fields will vary depending on the crosstab dimension you have chosen in the report table. In our case, the expression we make is &quot;$f{September}+$f{October 2010}+$f{November 2010}&quot;:</para>
<para>Each row of the table have a totals column to the right.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Groups of tables</title>
<para>There are cases when it can be useful to have several tables in one report. This can be done using Report groups. Using this functionality, one can for example create a report one table for each indicator, or one table of each geographic location. In the following, we will go through the steps needed to make a report with three indicators, each represented in one table. It is important that the report table does not crosstab on indicators when we want to make groups of tables based on indicators. </para>
<para>In our example, the .jrxml file downloaded from FSNIS will by default have one column for geographic location and on for indicators (assuming we have chosen periods as the only crosstab dimension). We start by removing the indicator column, since this in not needed in our case, and realign the other fields to fit the report.</para>

<para>A window will appear, with a report group wizard. Select a name for the group, in this case we choose «Indicator». In the drop down menu, we can select what columns in the report table we want the groups to be based on. So, if we wanted one table for each geographic location, we would choose geographic location name as the report object to group according to. However, since we are grouping by indicators in this example, we choose indicator name. Then click next. </para>

<para>If you upload and run the report, it will now create one table for each indicator. However, it will not look very good as there will be no header row over each table - only one header at the top of each page. Also, there is no indication as to which table is showing which indicator. In the following, we will fix this.</para>
<para>Instead of having the title row in the column header, we can instead move it to the Group header. This will make the heading show up above each individual table. Furthermore, we can add a heading to each table with the name of the indicator. </para>

<title>Sorting and grouping</title>
<para>When using grouping, some precautions must be taken with regards to sorting. Notably, when adding sorting parameters, whatever parameter is used as basis for the grouping must come first. Thus if you are grouping the report by indicator and want sort the geographic locations alphabetically, you have to choose to sort first by indicator, then by geographic location name as shown below.

<title>Charts</title>
<para>By default, a 3D bar chart is included in the .jrxml file that is downloaded from FSNIS. This is set up so that only data from the «parameter geographic location» (often the parent or grand parent) is used. Usually, this is a good solution. Since it is the default, we will start by looking at bar charts, before looking at line charts.</para>

<title>Line charts</title>
<para>Line charts can be useful in many circumstances. However, to make line charts the report data (report table) must be suited for it. Thus if you want to make a line chart, it is important that the report table does not have periods in the crosstab dimension. Examples where this is useful is if you are making a report for a single geographic location with one or more indicators or if you are making a report with one indicator and one or more geographic locations.</para>
<para>Below, we will go though the steps needed to make a report with a line chart showing the development of three indicators over one year, for one geographic location. We start by making a report table with the choices shown below:</para>

<para>Next, adjust the size and position of the chart in your report. Then, we will add one data series for each of our three indicators. Right-click on the chart and choose Chart data. If you are making a chart with one indicator and several geographic locations, you probably want to make a filter expression so that only data from the parameter/parent geographic location is used in the chart. To do this, add this line to the Filter expression area:</para>
<para><command>$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals(&quot;Yes&quot;)</command></para>
<para>In our example, we only have on geographic location, so this is not necessary. Next, click the details tab to see a list of the series in the chart. For now, this list is empty but we will add one series for each of our three indicators. To add a series, click the Add button.</para>

<title>Setting up GIS</title>
<section>
<title>Context</title>
<para>Setting up the GIS simply means storing coordinates for the geographic locations you want to show on the map in the database. Coordinates are often distributed in proprietary formats and will need to be converted to a format which FSNIS uses. ESRI shapefiles are the most common geospatial vector data format for desktop applications. You might find shapefiles for your country <ulink url="http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata">here</ulink> or in many other geospatial data repositories on the web. Some amount of work needs to be done in order to use these coordinates in FSNIS GIS, namely transforming the data into a suitable format and ensuring the name which are contained in the geospatial data match exactly with the names of the organization units which they should be matched to. </para>
<para>If you go to the geographic location module and edit one of the units, you can see a text field called Coordinates. Here you may fill in its coordinates directly (geojson format) which is useful if you just want to update a couple of units.</para>
<para>An example point/station coordinate:</para>
<para><programlisting><userinput>[29.341,-11.154]</userinput></programlisting></para>
<para>An example polygon/area coordinates string:</para>
<para><programlisting><userinput>[[[[29.343,-11.154],[28.329,-11.342],[28.481,-10.239],[29.833,-10.412]]]]</userinput></programlisting></para>
<para>However, if you are going to e.g. add coordinates for all units at a certain level you don&apos;t want to do that manually. This is where the automatic GML import comes into play and the following section explains the preferred way of using it.<important>
<para>The only co-ordinate reference system supported by FSNIS is EPSG:4326, also known as geographic longitude/latitude. Coordinates must be stored with the longitude (east/west position) proceeding the latitude (north/south position). If your vector data is in a different CRS than EPSG 4326, you will need to re project the data first before importing into FSNIS. </para>
</important></para>

<section id="gisSetup">
<title>Importing coordinates</title>
<para>Step 1 - Simplify/generalize your geographic data</para>
<para>The boundaries in geographic data files are usually very accurate, too much so for the needs of a web-based GIS. This usually does not affect the performance when using GIS files on a a local system but it is usually necessary to optimize the geographic data for the web-based GIS system of FSNIS. All geographic data needs to be downloaded from the server and rendered in a browser so if the data is overly complex, the performance of the FSNIS GIS will be negatively impacted. This optimization process can be described as follows:</para>
<para><simplelist>
<member>Coordinates: The number of significant decimal digits (e.g. 23.02937874993774) should be shortened to fewer digits (e.g. 23.03). Although this will result in some inaccuracies on the map, given the usual scale at which maps in FSNIS are produced (&gt; 1:50,000), the loss of precision should not be noticeable. Normally, no more than four significant digits after the decimal point should be necessary.</member>
<member>Polygons: In addition to shortening the number of significant digits, the actual number of points should also be reduced to an optimal level. Finding this optimal level may take a bit of experimentation. Decreasing the precision of the points as well as the number of points through generalization, will lead to degradation of the polygon. However, after a bit of experimentation, an optimal level of generalization can be found, where the accuracy of the polygon is visually acceptable, and the performance of the GIS is optimal. </member>
</simplelist></para>
<para>For polygons, we need to make the boundary lines less detailed by removing some of the line points. One possible method is the use of <ulink url="http://mapshaper.com/test/MapShaper.swf">MapShaper</ulink> which is an online tool which can be used to generalize geographic data. To use MapShaper, simply upload your shapefile to the site. Then, at the center bottom you see a slider that starts at 0%. It is usually acceptable to drag it up to about 80%. In the left menu you can check &quot;show original lines&quot; to compare the result and you may want to give a different simplification method a try. When you are happy with the result, click &quot;export&quot; in the top right corner. Then check the first of the four options called &quot;Shapefile - polygons&quot;, click &quot;create&quot; and wait for the download buttons to appear. Now, download the two files to your local computer (being sure to rename the file so that you do not overwrite your existing, original data). Move on to the next step with your new simplified shapefile.
</para>
<para>Step 2 - Convert the shapefile to GML</para>
<para>
The recommended tool for geographic format conversions is called &quot;ogr2ogr&quot;. This should be available for most Linux distributions <command>sudo apt-get install gdal-bin</command>. For Windows, go to <ulink url="http://fwtools.maptools.org/">http://fwtools.maptools.org/ </ulink>and download &quot;FWTools&quot;, install it and open up the FWTools command shell. During the format conversion we also want to ensure that the output has the correct coordinate projection (called EPSG:4326 with geographic longitude and latitude). For a more detailed reference of geographic coordinates, please refer to this <ulink url="http://www.epsg-registry.org/">site</ulink>. If you have already reprojected the geographic data to the geographic latitude/longitude (EPSG:4326) system, there is no need to explicitly define the output coordinate system, assuming that <command>ogr2ogr</command> can determine the input spatial reference system. Note that most shapefiles are using the EPSG:4326 system. You can determine the spatial reference system by executing the following command.</para>
<para><programlisting><userinput>ogrinfo -al -so filename.shp</userinput></programlisting></para>
<para>Assuming that the projection is reported to be EPSG:27700 by <command>ogrinfo</command>, we can transform it to EPSG:4326 by executing the following command.<programlisting><userinput>ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:27700 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f GML filename.gml filename.shp </userinput></programlisting></para>
<para>If the geographic data is already in EPSG:4326, you can simply transform the shapefile to GML by executing the following command. </para>
<para><programlisting><userinput>ogr2ogr -f GML filename.gml filename.shp</userinput></programlisting></para>
<para> You will find the created GML file in the same folder as the shapefile.
</para>
<para>Step 3 - Prepare the GML file</para>
<para>Unfortunately, the GML file is not ready for importation yet. Open it in a robust text editor like Geany (Linux) or Notepad++ (Windows). GML is an XML based format which means that you will recognize the regular XML tag hierarchy. In the GML file an geographic location is represented as a &lt;gml:featureMember&gt;. Inside the feature members we usually find a lot of attributes, but we are just going to import their coordinates. In order to do this FSNIS will match the name of the feature members to the geographic location names in the database. To get the name of the feature members in the GML file the importer will look for a property called &quot;ogr:Name&quot;. Figure out what property that is holding the name of the feature members (could be &quot;ogr:DISTRICT_NAME&quot;, &quot;ogr:NAME_1&quot; or whatever, this differs from shapefile to shapefile) and rename it to &quot;ogr:Name&quot;. Ensure that both the start and the end tags are renamed properly. They are supposed to look like e.g.: &lt;ogr:Name&gt;Moyamba District&lt;/ogr:Name&gt;
</para>
<para>Note that the name of the feature members in the GML file must be spelled exactly the same as the geographic locations in the database. Otherwise the importer will not recognize it and thus not transfer any coordinates. E.g. &quot;Moyamba&quot; in the GML file might be called &quot;Moyamba District&quot; in the database. Creative use of the &quot;rename all&quot; function in the text editor is usually of great help in these situations, as you do not want to edit numerous feature members manually. Have a brief look at the names and compare them to the names in the database. If they seem to match fairly good, it is about time to do a preview in the import-export module.
</para>
<para>
Go to Services -&gt; Import-Export, select &quot;Preview&quot;, select the GML file and click &quot;Import&quot;. Look for new/updated geographic locations. Our intention is to add coordinates to already existing geographic locations in the database, so we want as many updates as possible and 0 new. Those listed as new will be created as root units and mess up the geographic location trees in FSNIS. If any listed as new, click the number and the geographic locations in question will appear in the list below. If there are any slight misspellings compared to the geographic location names in the database - fix them and do the preview again. Otherwise, click the &quot;discard all&quot; button below the list and then the &quot;Import all&quot; button above the list.
</para>
<para>
If the import process completes successfully, you should now be able to utilize the geographic data in the FSNIS GIS. If not, check the log for hints and look for common errors such as:
</para>
<para>- Name duplicates in the GML file. The name column in the database is unique and does not accept two geographic locations with the same name.</para>
<para>- The &quot;shortname&quot; column in the organisationunit table in your database has a too small varchar definition. Increase it to 100.</para>
<para>- Special name characters in the GML file. Be sure to convert these to appropirate XML equivalents or escape sequences.</para>
