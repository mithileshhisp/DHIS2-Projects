  <comment>DHIS Support Commons is intended to be a lightweight library with very few and
    no heavy dependencies, as well as no internal dependencies (DHIS modules).
    This includes not depending on the dhis-support-test package, meaning any unit
    tests must be added to an external package (dhis-support-system is a reasonable
    choice). NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
